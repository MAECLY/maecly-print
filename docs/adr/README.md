# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

> **TL;DR** — This folder contains the architectural decisions for Pluryprint, recorded in **Michael Nygard's ADR format**. Each file captures one decision: the context that forced it, the alternatives considered, the choice made, and the consequences. ADRs are append-only — once accepted, an ADR is never edited; it is **superseded** by a new ADR if the decision changes.

## Format

We use the format proposed by Michael Nygard in [*Documenting Architecture Decisions*](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions). Each ADR has these sections:

1. **Title** — short noun phrase, prefixed with the four-digit ID.
2. **Status** — one of: `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Superseded by ADR-XXXX`, `Deprecated`, `Rejected`.
3. **Date** — ISO 8601 date the decision was last changed.
4. **Context** — the situation, the forces at play, the constraints. Plain technical English; no decisions yet.
5. **Decision** — what we chose, in active voice. ("We will use X.")
6. **Alternatives Considered** — a table or list of other options, with a one-line reason each was not picked.
7. **Consequences** — what becomes easier and what becomes harder. Three sub-sections recommended: **Positive**, **Negative**, **Risks / Open Questions**.

## Conventions

- IDs are sequential and zero-padded to four digits (`0001`, `0002`, ...). Once assigned, an ID is permanent.
- Filenames are `NNNN-kebab-case-title.md`.
- ADRs are written in present tense for the decision (you are documenting what we *will* do as of today) and past tense for context.
- We avoid product-marketing language. ADRs are technical artifacts read by future contributors trying to understand "why on earth did they choose this?"
- Keep them short. Most ADRs should be 80–180 lines; longer means the decision should probably be split into multiple ADRs.

### Superseding

When a decision changes, **do not edit the original ADR**. Instead:

1. Write a new ADR explaining the new decision and its context.
2. Reference the old ADR in the new one's *Context* section: "ADR-0003 originally chose X; new evidence shows Y, so we are revisiting."
3. Update the old ADR's `Status:` line to `Superseded by ADR-XXXX` and add a one-line note at the top pointing to the new ADR. **No other change to the old ADR.**

This preserves the historical record of why we used to do things differently — invaluable for future maintainers and for evaluating whether the new decision was right.

### Deprecating

If a decision is no longer relevant but is not being replaced (e.g., we removed a subsystem), mark its `Status:` as `Deprecated` and add a one-line note explaining what happened. Again, leave the body intact.

## Contributing a new ADR

1. Pick the next free ID. Check the index above.
2. Copy `template.md` to `NNNN-kebab-case-title.md` (template provided alongside this README).
3. Fill in all sections. **Do not skip Alternatives Considered** — an ADR without alternatives is not an ADR, it is a press release.
4. Open a PR titled `ADR-NNNN: <title>`. The PR is the discussion forum.
5. On merge, update this index.

## Why we keep ADRs

- **Onboarding.** New contributors can read `adr/` cover-to-cover and understand the shape of the codebase faster than reading code.
- **Avoiding revisits.** When someone asks "why don't we use Electron?", the answer is `ADR-0001` and the conversation is over in three seconds.
- **Honest history.** The Alternatives sections record what we genuinely considered, not what we want to claim we considered.
- **Constraint propagation.** A new ADR can call out that it is *constrained* by an earlier one (e.g., "ADR-0002 means we cannot use proprietary X").
