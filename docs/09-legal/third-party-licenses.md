# Third-Party Licenses

> **TL;DR.** Pluryprint is AGPL-3.0-only. It bundles SumatraPDF on Windows (GPL-3.0, with MuPDF inside under AGPL-3.0 — fetched at packaging time by `scripts/fetch-sumatrapdf.*`, never committed) and depends on Tauri/Rust/React (all permissive licenses, AGPL-compatible). External tools we invoke as subprocesses (LibreOffice; Edge/Chrome only as a hidden fallback) are not embedded; per FSF guidance, subprocess invocation does not create a derivative work, so their licenses do not constrain our license. The notices themselves ship in every bundle as [`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`](../../THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md), with `LICENSE` and the texts in `LICENSES/`.

This document inventories every third-party component Pluryprint depends on, with its license, our usage pattern (embedded vs subprocess), and the AGPL-3.0 compatibility analysis. This is the source of truth for legal compliance; the notice that ships with the app, covering every transitive crate as well, is [`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`](../../THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md) at the repository root.

If you find a discrepancy or a missing component, file an issue immediately.

## Master inventory

The tables below are derived from the **actual manifests**: `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `shell-ext-win/Cargo.toml` and `package.json`. Versions are the declared requirements, not resolved lockfile versions; the per-release inventory of every crate and package that ships, transitive ones included, is [`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`](../../THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md) (see "Compliance artifacts we ship"). Licenses marked *(typical)* are the customary license of that crate and must be confirmed against the generated manifest before a release.

### Rust — `src-tauri` (direct dependencies, all linked into the binary)

### Rust — `shell-ext-win` (the Windows Explorer handler, a separate `cdylib`)

| Crate | Declared version | License (typical) | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `serde`, `serde_json` | 1 | MIT / Apache-2.0 | The handoff payload |
| `uuid` | 1 (`v7`) | MIT / Apache-2.0 | Handoff file names |
| `time` | 0.3 | MIT / Apache-2.0 | `invoked_at` stamps |

| `embed-resource` *(build-dependency)* | 3 | MIT | Embeds `res/shellext.rc`, including the side-by-side `<msix>` manifest |
| `tempfile` *(dev-dependency)* | 3 | MIT / Apache-2.0 | Tests only; not distributed |

This crate is deliberately **not** a workspace member (see [`../04-architecture/security-model.md`](../04-architecture/security-model.md) §3.1), so it carries its own lockfile and its own license surface.

### Frontend — `package.json` runtime dependencies (bundled into the app)

| Package | Declared version | License | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `react`, `react-dom` | ^18.3.1 | MIT | UI runtime |
| `@tauri-apps/api` | ^2.1.1 | MIT / Apache-2.0 | IPC + event bridge |
| `@tauri-apps/plugin-dialog` | ^2.7.1 | MIT / Apache-2.0 | File picker binding |
| `zustand` | ^5.0.14 | MIT | Frontend state |
| `sonner` | ^1.7.1 | MIT | Toasts |
| JetBrains Mono (font, bundled `.woff2`) | — | SIL OFL 1.1 | Monospace typeface shipped offline |

Localization is **in-house** (`src/i18n/`), not `react-i18next`; there is no i18n runtime dependency.

### Frontend — build/dev only (not distributed)

`vite`, `typescript`, `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, `autoprefixer`, `eslint` (+ plugins), `prettier`, `vitest`, `@vitest/coverage-v8`, `jsdom`, `@testing-library/*`, `@wdio/*` (WebDriver e2e), `husky`, `lint-staged`, `@commitlint/*`, `@tauri-apps/cli` — all MIT or ISC.

Two notes: **Tailwind CSS is MIT and its generated CSS *is* distributed** in the bundle (it is listed here because the tool is build-time; the output is ours). **WebDriverIO (`@wdio/*`) is the e2e driver**, not Playwright.

### Non-crate components

| Component | License | Used for | Embedded? | AGPL-3.0 compatible? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SumatraPDF (**3.6.1**, pinned) | **GPL-3.0** (MuPDF inside it: AGPL-3.0) | PDF printing on Windows | Yes — fetched at packaging time and bundled as a separate program | Yes; see the compliance note below |
| LibreOffice | MPL 2.0 | Office and OpenDocument → PDF, and RTF on Windows | No (subprocess) | Yes (separate) |
| Chromium / Microsoft Edge | BSD 3-Clause (Chromium core) | Only the hidden `html_renderer = "browser"` fallback for HTML, Markdown and text (Google Chrome or Chromium also work); the default is the system web view | No (subprocess) | Yes (separate) |
| sips / Windows Imaging Component | OS components | HEIC/HEIF decoding (`sips` on macOS; WIC plus the Store *HEIF Image Extensions* and *HEVC Video Extensions* on Windows); macOS `textutil` likewise turns RTF into HTML | No (system tool / OS API) | Yes (separate) |
| CUPS `lp` | Apache 2.0 (system component) | Printing on macOS/Linux | No (system binary) | Yes (separate) |
| WebView2 loader | BSD-style Microsoft license (loader); Edge engine system-installed | Webview rendering, and printing HTML, Markdown and text in the render worker | Loader statically linked; engine system | Yes (loader); engine N/A |
| WKWebView (macOS) | Apple SLA | Webview rendering, and printing HTML, Markdown and text in the render worker | No (system framework) | N/A (system) |
| NSIS (via `tauri build`) | zlib/libpng | Windows installer | No (build-time only) | N/A |

**Removed from this inventory because they are not used:** `reqwest` (replaced by `ureq`), `tauri-plugin-cli` (the CLI is plain `clap`), `winreg`, `which`, `mime_guess`, `infer`, `rayon`, `notify`, `react-i18next`, `@radix-ui/*`, `react-hook-form`, `@tanstack/react-query`, `lucide-react`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `playwright`, Inno Setup, create-dmg, and Pandoc (Markdown converts in-process with `pulldown-cmark` since round 3). **ImageMagick and qpdf are not invoked at all**: images are converted in-process with the `image` crate, and there is no PDF preprocessing step.

For each entry below: the license text source, how we use it, and any compliance notes.

## Embedded components (linked into our binary)

These are statically or dynamically linked into `pluryprint.exe`/`pluryprint` and form a combined work with our code.

### Tauri (MIT / Apache 2.0 dual-license)

- **Used for:** the application framework (main process, IPC, plugins, updater).
- **License text:** [https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/LICENSE_MIT](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/LICENSE_MIT) and [https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/LICENSE_APACHE-2.0](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/LICENSE_APACHE-2.0).
- **Compatibility:** MIT and Apache 2.0 are both permissive and compatible with GPLv3, and so with the AGPL-3.0. We can include them in an AGPL-3.0 work freely.
- **Compliance:** Tauri and its crates are listed in [`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`](../../THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md), which ships in every bundle; the Apache-2.0 text ships beside it in `LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt`.

### Rust standard library + crates ecosystem

- **Used for:** language runtime + the utility crates listed in the inventory above.
- **License:** Mostly MIT/Apache 2.0 dual.
- **Compatibility:** all AGPL-3.0-compatible. Beyond MIT and Apache-2.0 the shipped crates use ISC, BSD-3-Clause, Zlib, Unicode-3.0, CDLA-Permissive-2.0 (`webpki-roots`) and MPL-2.0 (`option-ext`, no "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses" notice); none is GPL-2.0-only. The list per crate is in [`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`](../../THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md).
- **Audit — not yet automated.** `cargo about generate` is described below as the intended mechanism, but there is **no `src-tauri/about.toml` and no `deny.toml` in the repository today**, and neither `cargo about` nor `cargo deny` runs in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Until those land, the inventory above is maintained by hand against the manifests, which is exactly the failure mode that produced the previous version of this document.

### React + TypeScript ecosystem

- **Used for:** the frontend. React / React DOM (MIT), Zustand (MIT), Sonner (MIT), the `@tauri-apps/*` JS packages (MIT / Apache-2.0), and Tailwind CSS (MIT) whose *generated* CSS ships in the bundle.
- **Localization is in-house** (`src/i18n/`): a small provider plus JSON catalogues per screen. No i18n library is bundled.
- **Compatibility:** AGPL-3.0-compatible.
- **Audit:** `pnpm licenses list` produces an inventory; wiring it into the release is still open (see above).

### `windows` (windows-rs)

- **Used for:** Win32 API bindings — `EnumPrinters` / `DeviceCapabilities` / `GetDefaultPrinter` in the app, and COM / `IExplorerCommand` in the shell extension.
- **License:** MIT / Apache 2.0 dual.
- **Compatibility:** AGPL-3.0-compatible.
- **Note:** the two crates pull the same 0.58 line but different feature sets; they are separate builds because the shell extension is a separate crate.

### `objc2`, `objc2-app-kit`, `objc2-foundation` (macOS only)

- **Used for:** the "Print with Pluryprint" NSServices provider declared in `Info.plist` (FR-001).
- **License:** MIT.
- **Compatibility:** AGPL-3.0-compatible.
- **Note:** versions are constrained to the ones tao/wry already resolve, so only one copy of the objc2 tree is linked.

### WebView2 (Windows webview)

- **Loader:** `webview2-com-sys` links Microsoft's `WebView2LoaderStatic.lib` statically into `pluryprint.exe` on the MSVC targets; no `WebView2Loader.dll` is shipped. Its license is a BSD-style Microsoft license, reproduced in [`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`](../../THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md).
- **Edge engine:** system-installed (preinstalled on Win 11; bootstrap on Win 10). Microsoft EULA governs it. We do not redistribute the engine itself.
- **Compatibility:** the loader's license is permissive. The engine being a system component (we link to it dynamically at runtime) is analogous to linking against the OS itself; this is the [system library exception](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#WindowsRuntimeAndGPL), which the AGPL-3.0 shares with the GPLv3.

### WKWebView (macOS webview)

- **Provided by macOS** as a system framework. We link against it dynamically.
- **Compatibility:** system library; same exception applies.

## Embedded data (bundled binaries we ship)

These are not linked but shipped as separate files in our installer.

### SumatraPDF 3.6.1 (GPL-3.0) — the one third-party program we redistribute

- **Used for:** silent PDF printing on Windows (`-print-to`, `-print-settings`, `-silent`, `-exit-when-done`). Not used on macOS/Linux, which print through CUPS `lp`.
- **License:** [GPL-3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html). The MuPDF library compiled into `SumatraPDF.exe` is [AGPL-3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html) (Artifex Software).
- **How it gets into the bundle:** `scripts/fetch-sumatrapdf.ps1` (Windows) / `scripts/fetch-sumatrapdf.sh` (POSIX twin, for cross-building CI and for verifying the pins off-Windows). They download the **pinned** upstream release, version `3.6.1`, for the target architecture: `https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/dl/rel/3.6.1/SumatraPDF-3.6.1-64.zip` for x64 and `...-arm64.zip` for ARM64 (an ARM64 installer carries the native ARM64 build, not the x64 one under emulation). Each archive is checked against a pinned SHA-256 (x64 `98b33a51...51877a544`, ARM64 `f21091ca...3667ffe`, computed on macOS and on Windows 11 ARM64 and identical to the hashes the Scoop `extras` bucket publishes for the same archives). The executable is installed as `SumatraPDF.exe` in `src-tauri/resources/sumatrapdf/`, and `tauri.conf.json` ships that directory via `bundle.resources` (`"resources/sumatrapdf/*": "resources/sumatrapdf/"`). The glob matches only the README on a macOS/Linux bundle.
- **The licence travels with it.** The portable archives contain the executable only, no licence file. The scripts therefore fetch `COPYING` (the GPL-3.0 text, byte-identical to our `LICENSES/GPL-3.0.txt`), `COPYING.BSD` and `AUTHORS` from the SumatraPDF repository at commit `16c59fde8b824ab54c56f23aef910a6fdd874ad0`, which the release tag `3.6.1rel` points to. Each file has its own pinned SHA-256, and a missing or altered file fails the script. They land next to the executable as `LICENSE.txt`, `COPYING.BSD.txt` and `AUTHORS.txt`, with a `SOURCE.txt` naming the version, architecture, archive URL and the source commit, and a `SOURCE-OFFER.txt` carrying the GPL-3.0 §6 written offer.
- **Why not committed:** ~16 MB of platform-specific artifact git would keep forever, paid for by every contributor including those who can never run it; and it is not ours to re-host. Fetching the vendor's own release at packaging time keeps provenance (and these GPL-3.0 obligations) where they belong. A pinned URL plus a pinned checksum is a stronger guarantee than a committed blob, and it is reviewable in a diff. `src-tauri/tests/fetch_scripts.rs` checks that both scripts carry the same pins and that the PowerShell one stays ASCII (Windows PowerShell 5.1 cannot parse a BOM-less UTF-8 script with typographic punctuation).
- **Source code:** [https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf](https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf), tag `3.6.1rel` (MuPDF is under `mupdf/`). Every Pluryprint release also attaches that exact tree as `SumatraPDF-3.6.1-source.tar.gz` (`.github/workflows/release.yml`).
- **Compatibility:** SumatraPDF is a separate program that Pluryprint runs as a process, so the two are an aggregate, not a combined work. Even if they were combined, section 13 of both the GPL-3.0 and the AGPL-3.0 explicitly allows linking one with the other. MuPDF is AGPL-3.0, the same license as Pluryprint.
- **Compliance (GPL-3.0 §6):** because we redistribute a GPL-3.0 binary we must offer its corresponding source. We do so by shipping the licence (`LICENSE.txt`, `COPYING.BSD.txt`, `AUTHORS.txt`) `SOURCE.txt`, which names the exact upstream commit, and `SOURCE-OFFER.txt`, the written offer, beside the executable, by attaching the source archive to every release, the GPL-3.0 text in `LICENSES/GPL-3.0.txt`, and a notice naming the version and the source tag in `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`, and by linking to the upstream repository from the About screen and from this document. **Pin the exact upstream version in the release notes** so "corresponding source" is unambiguous.

### Future bundled components

If we ever bundle Pandoc (GPLv2-or-later) or another GPL'd binary, the same compliance pattern applies: pin the version and checksum, bundle the license text, link to the source, and name the version in the release notes.

## External components (subprocess invocation)

These are tools we shell out to with `std::process::Command`. We never bundle them; they must be installed by the user separately (the app probes for them and reports what is missing — `engine::deps`, FR-058). CUPS `lp` (macOS/Linux), LibreOffice, macOS `sips` and `textutil`, and, only under the hidden fallback, a Chromium-class browser are all invoked as separate processes, each with an argument vector and never through a shell. **Per the [FSF's guidance](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLPlugins) and [Mere Aggregation FAQ](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#MereAggregation), subprocess invocation does not create a combined work, so the subprocess's license does not infect ours.**

Quoting the FSF directly:

> "If two programs run at the same time and communicate using exec, fork, or pipes, then they are normally separate programs."

This is the legal foundation for using LibreOffice (MPL 2.0) and Chromium (BSD 3-Clause) in an AGPL-3.0 project without those licenses contaminating ours.

### LibreOffice (MPL 2.0)

- **Used for:** Office document → PDF conversion. Invoked as `soffice --headless --convert-to pdf <file>`.
- **License:** [Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/).
- **Embedded?** No. Subprocess only.
- **Compatibility:** MPL 2.0 is a weak copyleft. Even if we did link against LibreOffice (we don't), MPL 2.0 has explicit GPL compatibility through the secondary license clause. As subprocess invocation, this is moot.
- **Compliance:** none required from us. We document the dependency; users install separately.

### Chromium / Microsoft Edge (BSD 3-Clause)

- **Used for:** nothing by default. Only the hidden `[engine] html_renderer = "browser"` fallback (kept for one version, ADR-0012) prints HTML, Markdown and text with `msedge --headless --print-to-pdf=<output> <input>`; the default is the system web view.
- **License:** [BSD 3-Clause](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) (Chromium core; Edge adds Microsoft proprietary code we don't redistribute).
- **Embedded?** No. Subprocess only. We use the system Edge installation.
- **Compatibility:** BSD 3-Clause is permissive; subprocess invocation makes this irrelevant anyway.

### Pandoc (GPLv2-or-later)

- **Used for:** nothing since round 3: Markdown converts in-process (`pulldown-cmark`). The dependency id stays only so an old `queue.json` that names it still loads.
- **License:** [GPLv2-or-later](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html). Pandoc itself is GPL.
- **Embedded?** No. Subprocess only.
- **Compatibility:** GPLv2-or-later can be used under GPLv3, which section 13 lets be combined with the AGPL-3.0. Subprocess invocation makes this moot.

### CUPS `lp` (Apache 2.0, system component)

- **Used for:** spooling the final PDF on macOS and Linux (`lp -d … -n … -o …`), and cancelling by the returned job id.
- **Embedded?** No. It is part of the operating system.
- **Compatibility:** a system utility invoked as a subprocess; nothing to comply with.

### Image conversion — no third party involved

Image → PDF conversion happens **inside** Pluryprint using the `image` and `lopdf` crates (both permissive, both in the inventory above). **ImageMagick is not used**, and `magick` is never invoked. Likewise there is **no qpdf step**: nothing linearizes or decrypts PDFs. Earlier versions of this document listed both; they were never dependencies.

## Build-time only (not distributed)

These tools are used to build Pluryprint but are not part of the distributed binary.

### Vite (MIT)

- **Used for:** frontend bundling.
- **Distributed?** No. Vite produces output JS/CSS/HTML; only the output is distributed.
- **Compliance:** none required.

### NSIS (via `tauri build`)

- **Used for:** building the Windows installer. `tauri.conf.json` sets `bundle.windows.nsis.installMode = "currentUser"`. **Inno Setup is not used**; earlier drafts said otherwise.
- **License:** zlib/libpng.
- **Distributed?** The NSIS stub is part of the produced installer; NSIS itself is not.

### Tailwind CSS / PostCSS / Autoprefixer (MIT)

- **Used for:** layout utilities only. Design tokens are CSS custom properties in `src/styles/tokens.css`; Tailwind's `preflight` is disabled.
- **Distributed?** The *generated* CSS is bundled; the toolchain is not.

### WebdriverIO (`@wdio/*`, MIT)

- **Used for:** the end-to-end lane (`pnpm test:e2e`, `e2e/wdio.conf.ts`). **Playwright is not used.**
- **Distributed?** No.

### MakeAppx, signtool, codesign, notarytool, pkgbuild, productbuild

- **Used for:** packaging and signing.
- **Distributed?** No. These are platform-vendor SDKs (Microsoft, Apple).
- **Compliance:** governed by Microsoft / Apple SDK terms, which permit normal developer use.

## Compliance artifacts we ship

Every bundle carries, via `bundle.resources` in `tauri.conf.json` (checked by `src-tauri/tests/licence_bundle.rs`):

```
<resource-dir>/
├── LICENSE                    # AGPL-3.0, Pluryprint's own license (full text)
├── THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md     # every shipped component, crate and package, with copyright lines
├── LICENSES/
│   ├── Apache-2.0.txt         # Apache-2.0-only crates, ring
│   ├── GPL-3.0.txt            # SumatraPDF
│   └── OFL-1.1.txt            # JetBrains Mono, with its copyright line
└── resources/sumatrapdf/      # Windows only, once fetched
    ├── SumatraPDF.exe
    └── LICENSE.txt            # SumatraPDF's own licence file, when its archive has one
```

On macOS `<resource-dir>` is `Pluryprint.app/Contents/Resources/`; on Windows it is the install folder.

`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` is generated. Its first part (SumatraPDF, the native code, the WebView2 loader, the NSIS installer stub, the font, the compatibility table) is hand-written in `scripts/licenses/notices-header.md`; the rest reproduces the licence text, with its copyright lines, of every crate compiled into the app or the Explorer DLL for the four release targets (cargo-about, `scripts/licenses/about.toml`) and of every frontend package in the bundle (`pnpm licenses list --prod`):

```bash
cargo install cargo-about --locked --features cli --version 0.9.2   # once
scripts/licenses/generate-notices.sh          # after any dependency change
scripts/licenses/generate-notices.sh --check  # CI's `notices` job
```

A crate whose licence is not in `about.toml`'s accepted list fails the generator instead of shipping unnoticed; adding a licence there needs the compatibility analysis in this document first. `src-tauri/tests/third_party_notices.rs` checks that every direct dependency has an entry and every entry is still in a lockfile.

## Compatibility check process

When adding a new dependency:

1. Identify its license (`cargo metadata` for Rust deps; `npm view <pkg> license` for frontend).
2. Cross-reference against the [FSF compatibility list](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html) or [SPDX license list](https://spdx.org/licenses/).
3. If AGPL-3.0-compatible: proceed.
4. If AGPL-3.0-incompatible (e.g. GPL-2.0-only, CDDL, EPL, MPL 1.x without dual-license, MPL-2.0 marked "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses"): **do not add**. Either find a replacement, refactor to subprocess invocation, or skip the feature.

**`cargo deny` is not wired up yet.** There is no `deny.toml` in the repository and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` does not run it, so today step 4 above is enforced by review only. The configuration below is the intended one and should be committed as `deny.toml` when the check lands:

```toml
# deny.toml — PROPOSED, not present in the repo
[licenses]
allow = [
  "MIT",
  "Apache-2.0",
  "Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception",
  "BSD-2-Clause",
  "BSD-3-Clause",
  "ISC",
  "Unicode-3.0",
  "Zlib",
  "CDLA-Permissive-2.0",
  "MPL-2.0",
  "AGPL-3.0",
]
deny = [
  "CDDL-1.0",
  "EPL-1.0",
  "EPL-2.0",
  "GPL-2.0",  # GPL-2.0-only is incompatible with the AGPL-3.0
]
```

Once committed, a PR that introduces a denied license will fail CI. Note that `AGPL-3.0` must stay on the allow list: the project's own crates are `AGPL-3.0-only`.

## "But is X legally a derivative work?"

The case for subprocess invocation **not** being a derivative work has been argued and accepted in many contexts. Beyond the FSF FAQ:

- [Software Freedom Law Center on subprocess invocation](https://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2009/the-fsf-policy-on-derivatives.html): "Programs running as separate processes are not combined into a single derivative work."
- [Linux Kernel position](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/process/license-rules.rst): the syscall boundary is treated as a license boundary.
- [LibreOffice's own FAQ](https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/licenses/) accepts subprocess invocation as a non-combining use pattern.

We are conservative: when there is doubt, we use subprocess invocation rather than embedding. The clearest example is LibreOffice (MPL 2.0) — even though MPL 2.0 has GPL/AGPL-compatibility clauses, the subprocess pattern removes any ambiguity about whether a combined work exists.
