# Non-Functional Requirements

> **TL;DR** — Quality attributes: how fast, how reliable, how secure, how accessible, how maintainable. Targets are concrete and testable; vague aspirations are not allowed here.

Non-functional requirements (NFRs) are the "ilities" that the system must satisfy across all features. Functional requirements (FRs) live in [functional-requirements.md](./functional-requirements.md).

Each NFR has a stable ID (`NFR-XXX`), a measurable target, and a verification method.

> **The "Verification" column is the *intended* method, not a claim that it runs.** Where an NFR is met, or where its stated verification does not exist, this is called out inline. The [Implementation status](#implementation-status) section at the end is the summary; it is the part to trust, because every line in it was checked against the tree.

## 1. Performance

| ID | Requirement | Target | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-001 | Cold start of the context menu invocation MUST complete the launch of the configuration GUI in <500 ms after right-click | p95 ≤ 500 ms on a 4-core/8 GB Win 11 machine with SSD | E2E test with stopwatch instrumentation |
| NFR-002 | Cold start of the silent print path (default profile, no GUI) MUST submit the first job to the spooler in <300 ms | p95 ≤ 300 ms | Same E2E test |
| NFR-003 | Idle RAM usage of the resident GUI MUST be <100 MB | RSS ≤ 100 MB after 60s idle | `ps`/Task Manager assertion in CI |
| NFR-004 | Peak RAM usage with 50 jobs queued MUST be <250 MB | RSS ≤ 250 MB | Load test |
| NFR-005 | The system MUST NOT add more than 50 ms of overhead to the total per-file printing time vs invoking the same backend (SumatraPDF/CUPS) directly | Δ ≤ 50 ms p50 | Microbenchmark in CI |
| NFR-006 | The Windows installer (`setup.exe`) MUST be ≤ 20 MB | size ≤ 20 MB | Size assertion in release pipeline — **in place**: `release.yml` fails a Windows build over 20 MiB (raised from 15 MiB on 2026-10-10, see below) and reports the size of every installer. Measured: the ARM64 installer is 13.48 MiB, about 8 MiB of it SumatraPDF ([releasing.md §9](../07-build-and-release/releasing.md)) |
| NFR-007 | The macOS `.dmg` MUST be ≤ 25 MB (universal binary) | size ≤ 25 MB | Same — **not gated**: releases ship one `.dmg` per architecture (`apple_silicon`, `apple_intel`), not a universal binary, and no step measures them |
| NFR-008 | The Sparse MSIX package MUST be ≤ 2 MB | size ≤ 2 MB | Same — **not applicable yet**: no sparse package is built (decision D3, [shell-extensions.md §2.5](../04-architecture/shell-extensions.md)) |

## 2. Reliability

| ID | Requirement | Target | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-010 | The system MUST recover unfinished queue items after an unexpected exit (crash, kill, OS reboot) | 100% of jobs not marked `printed` resume on next launch | Crash-restart integration test |
| NFR-011 | The system MUST NOT corrupt the user's source files. Print engine adapters MUST treat input files as **read-only**. | Zero hash mismatches on test corpus after a full print cycle | File hash verification in CI |
| NFR-012 | A print/convert timeout MUST NOT leak processes; orphan children MUST be killed | **Met**: the dispatcher uses `wait-timeout` for a bounded wait and kills the child, so a hung subprocess cannot wedge the queue. Covered by `src-tauri/tests/print_timeout.rs`. There is no `stress` feature. | Integration test |
| NFR-013 | The system MUST tolerate the disappearance of an external dependency mid-job (e.g., LibreOffice uninstalled) by failing the job cleanly with a typed error | Test passes with `pkill soffice` mid-conversion | Chaos test |
| NFR-014 | The system MUST support running a single instance only. A second invocation MUST send its arguments to the running instance via IPC and exit. | Pass: spawn 10 invocations in parallel, only 1 process exists | Concurrency test — **Met**: `tauri-plugin-single-instance` plus `cli/single_instance.rs`; the 10-way spawn test is not automated |

## 3. Security

| ID | Requirement | Target | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-020 | The application MUST install and run without administrator privileges for normal use | Install in `%LOCALAPPDATA%`, register in `HKCU` only | Manual QA on standard user account |
| NFR-021 | All released binaries MUST be code-signed with a valid certificate (EV cert preferred for Windows from day 1) | `signtool verify /pa` passes; Apple `codesign -dvv` passes; notarization passes | Release pipeline gate — **not met, by decision**: [ADR-0011](../adr/0011-release-channel.md) ships without Apple or Microsoft certificates; updates are signed with Pluryprint's own minisign key and every release lists SHA-256 checksums, and the release notes explain the Gatekeeper and SmartScreen warnings |
| NFR-022 | All update artifacts MUST be cryptographically signed; the client MUST refuse unsigned or wrongly-signed updates | Tampered update is rejected with `SignatureMismatch` error | Updater integration test |
| NFR-023 | The application MUST NOT make any unsolicited network requests except to the configured update server | Network audit shows only the update manifest's host (`github.com` release assets for the user's channel, or `PLURYPRINT_UPDATE_ENDPOINT`) | Wireshark capture in QA — not run. By construction: the converters and render workers get no network (dead proxies, request filters, a hardened LibreOffice profile), and a dependency install reaches winget, Homebrew or a web page only after the user's consent |
| NFR-024 | The shell extension COM DLL MUST be limited to: receive selection, serialize to file/stdin, spawn the main executable. It MUST NOT touch user data. | Code review + LOC budget ≤ 1500 | Code review checklist |
| NFR-025 | The application MUST validate all file paths from the shell extension as canonical absolute paths before passing to converters (no path traversal). | Fuzz test with `..\..\..\Windows\System32` payloads | Fuzz harness |
| NFR-026 | All third-party converter invocations MUST use **arg vector** APIs (`Command::new(...).args(...)`), never shell strings, to prevent command injection. | Code review; clippy lint `clippy::cmd_arg_string` enabled | Static analysis — every converter, worker and the winget/brew dependency installs use an argument vector; `clippy::cmd_arg_string` is not a real lint, so this is held by review and the `process` tests |
| NFR-027 | Secrets (signing private keys, future API tokens) MUST NEVER be committed; CI uses GitHub Secrets / OIDC. | **No gitleaks scan exists.** `ci.yml` reads no secret; `release.yml` reads the updater key from the `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` GitHub secret and stops when it is unset. The private key lives outside the repository. | — |

## 4. Usability

| ID | Requirement | Target | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-030 | A first-time user MUST be able to print a single PDF from the context menu in <30 seconds end-to-end after install | Usability test n=5, all complete | Recorded user test |
| NFR-031 | All defaults MUST be sane such that the application is useful without opening Settings | Verified by zero-config quick start in user test | Same |
| NFR-032 | Destructive actions (delete profile, clear history) MUST require confirmation with a clear "Undo" affordance for 5 seconds. | UI assertion in component tests | Vitest |
| NFR-033 | Error messages MUST be actionable: state what went wrong, what the user can do, and provide a link to logs. Vague "Something went wrong" is forbidden. | PR review checklist + lint rule for empty `.message` | Code review |
| NFR-034 | The system MUST provide keyboard shortcuts for all primary actions (print, cancel, switch profile, open queue). | Documented in the app | **Met** — see status section |
| NFR-035 | All UI text MUST avoid jargon when a plain-language equivalent exists; jargon allowed in Advanced Settings. | Editorial pass before each release | Release checklist |

## 5. Accessibility

| ID | Requirement | Target | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-040 | The GUI MUST conform to **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** | *Stated target.* **The stated verification does not exist**: there is no axe-core dependency and no Playwright — the E2E suite is WebdriverIO. | Partly covered by component tests |
| NFR-041 | The GUI MUST be fully operable with a keyboard alone (no mouse required) | Manual keyboard-only walkthrough in release checklist | Manual QA |
| NFR-042 | All interactive controls MUST have visible focus indicators with ≥3:1 contrast against background | Per-primitive Vitest assertions that a focus ring is painted (the `.mp-focus` class), plus manual contrast review. No axe-core. | Vitest + QA |
| NFR-043 | All non-decorative images and icons MUST have text alternatives (`aria-label`, `alt`, etc.) | Accessible-name assertions in the primitives' and screens' Vitest suites. No axe-core. | Vitest |
| NFR-044 | The application MUST be compatible with screen readers (NVDA on Windows, VoiceOver on macOS) | Manual smoke test with screen reader before each release | Release checklist |
| NFR-045 | Color MUST NOT be the only carrier of meaning; status uses icon + label + color. | Component review | Code review |

## 6. Internationalization

| ID | Requirement | Target | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-050 | All user-facing strings MUST be externalized; no string literals in JSX/Rust user-facing paths | Real layout is `src/i18n/locales/{lang}/{namespace}.json`, not a flat `i18n/{lang}.json`. **No lint enforces this**: the ESLint rule does not exist, and `#[deny(string_literal_in_user_text)]` is not a real attribute. Enforced by review only. | Code review |
| NFR-051 | The translation framework MUST support pluralization and interpolation | **Partly met, by a different mechanism.** `src/i18n/` is dependency-free — not ICU MessageFormat and not i18next. It supports `{placeholder}` interpolation and `_one`/`_other` plural keys selected by a numeric `count`, with English rules. Gendered forms and ICU date/number formatting are **not** supported. | `src/i18n/i18n.test.ts` |
| NFR-052 | The system MUST support adding a new language with no code changes | **Not met as written.** A language is a directory of eight namespace JSONs, and `src/i18n/index.ts` imports each one statically, so adding a language edits code. English is the source of truth and missing keys fall back to it. | — |
| NFR-053 | Layouts MUST handle text expansion of +50% without truncation or overlap | **Unverified.** No pseudolocale, no snapshot tests at 150%. | — |
| NFR-054 | The system SHOULD be RTL-ready by v2.0 (logical CSS properties, no hard-coded `left`/`right`) | RTL pseudolocale snapshot test | Future |

## 7. Maintainability

| ID | Requirement | Target | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-060 | Test coverage MUST be ≥70% for Rust code, ≥60% for TS code | **Measured locally, not gated**: `cargo llvm-cov` (not tarpaulin) and `pnpm test:coverage`; CI is kept to lint, typecheck and tests. Last measured: Rust 80.4% lines, TS 61.4% lines. | Local measurement |
| NFR-061 | All public Rust functions MUST have rustdoc with at least a one-line summary | **Enforced.** `#![deny(missing_docs)]` is set in both `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` and `shell-ext-win/src/lib.rs`, so every reachable `pub` item — functions, types, fields, variants, constants, modules — needs a doc comment or the crate does not compile. Checked on macOS and on the Windows target (the `cfg(windows)` code). | Compiler (every CI build) |
| NFR-062 | Documentation in this `docs/` folder MUST stay in sync with code; PRs that modify behavior MUST update affected docs | Reviewer checklist | Code review |
| NFR-063 | The CI MUST be green for a PR to be merged (no override without maintainer approval and reason in commit) | Branch protection rule | GitHub settings |
| NFR-064 | Build MUST be reproducible: same source + same toolchain version → byte-identical binary | `cargo build --locked --release` is reproducible | Quarterly verification |
| NFR-065 | Deps MUST be audited weekly via `cargo audit` and `pnpm audit`; high/critical vulnerabilities MUST be fixed within 7 days. | **No audit workflow exists.** No CI job runs on a schedule. Dependabot is the sole dependency automation. | — |

## 8. Portability

| ID | Requirement | Target | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-070 | A single codebase MUST support Windows (x64, ARM64) and macOS (Apple Silicon, Intel) | **Built for all four on release.** `release.yml` builds `aarch64-apple-darwin`, `x86_64-apple-darwin`, `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` and `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc` and refuses a release missing any of them. `ci.yml` tests natively on Windows x64 and macOS; the ARM64 Windows build is cross-compiled by `release.yml`. Tests run natively on Windows x64 and ARM64 (the VM) and on Apple silicon; no Intel Mac runs them. No universal binary. | CI + release |
| NFR-071 | Platform-specific code MUST be isolated to clearly named modules | **Met.** `src-tauri/src/platform/`: `windows.rs`, `cups.rs`, `macos/`. Windows is a single file rather than a directory; the isolation requirement is satisfied either way. | Code review |
| NFR-072 | The system MUST NOT require Linux support in v1; Linux MAY be added in v2 if community demand exists | Documented in [milestones.md](../06-roadmap/milestones.md) | Roadmap |

## 9. Observability

| ID | Requirement | Target | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-080 | All log entries MUST be structured (JSONL) with: timestamp (ISO 8601), level, target/module, message, optional fields | `tracing-subscriber` JSON formatter | Unit test on log format |
| NFR-081 | Logs MUST roll daily and by size; retention bounded | **Met, with a tightened policy**: `logging::Policy` rolls daily *and* at a size ceiling, then sweeps by `retain_days` (14) **and** `retain_files` (7) — whichever bound bites first wins. The sweep runs at startup and again on every roll, so a resident instance stays bounded without a restart. | `logging` unit tests |
| NFR-082 | Sensitive data (file contents, full paths if user opts) MUST never be logged at default level | Log audit at QA | Manual QA |
| NFR-083 | The system MAY include an opt-in crash reporter (Sentry-compatible) disabled by default | Documented in Settings | Privacy doc |

## 10. Privacy

See [privacy.md](../09-legal/privacy.md) for the full statement.

| ID | Requirement | Target | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-090 | The system MUST NOT collect telemetry by default. | No telemetry endpoint reachable in default config | Network audit |
| NFR-091 | File contents MUST never leave the user's machine | Integration test asserts no network egress during a print job (other than to the printer) | Wireshark in CI optional |
| NFR-092 | If a future opt-in telemetry feature is added, it MUST be **off by default** and require explicit affirmative consent. | Design review of telemetry doc | Governance |

## 11. Compliance

| ID | Requirement | Target | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-100 | The project MUST comply with AGPL-3.0 obligations: source disclosure, license text in distribution, copyright notices preserved. | `LICENSE`, `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` and `LICENSES/` present in the bundle (`src-tauri/tests/licence_bundle.rs`); About links the source, the license, the CLA and the notices. `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` is generated (`scripts/licenses/generate-notices.sh`, checked current by `release.yml`'s guard before any release build), SumatraPDF ships with its GPL-3.0 written source offer (`SOURCE-OFFER.txt`), and every release attaches the Pluryprint and SumatraPDF sources | Release checklist |
| NFR-101 | All bundled third-party components MUST be license-compatible with the AGPL-3.0. See [third-party-licenses.md](../09-legal/third-party-licenses.md). | License audit per release | Release checklist |
| NFR-102 | The project MUST publish a SECURITY.md with a private vulnerability disclosure channel. | File exists, channel works | Release checklist |

## Implementation status

Verified against the tree. Only NFRs whose status is non-obvious or has recently changed are listed; anything absent from this table has not been assessed and must not be assumed met.

### Met

| ID | Evidence |
|---|---|
| **NFR-012** | `wait-timeout` bounded wait + kill in the dispatcher; `src-tauri/tests/print_timeout.rs`. |
| **NFR-014** | `tauri-plugin-single-instance`; `src-tauri/src/cli/single_instance.rs`; a second launch hands its argv to the running instance instead of racing it over `queue.json`. |
| **NFR-034** | **Newly met.** `APP_SHORTCUTS` in `src/components/AppShell/MPAppShell.tsx` is a single table with three consumers that cannot disagree: `App` (owns the actions), `MPSidebar` (prints key caps), and Home (documents the full set). Six shortcuts cover the four primary actions the requirement names plus the two job entry points: `newJob` (N), `printFolder` (O), `print` (P), `switchProfile` (K), `openQueue` (J), `cancel` (`.`). `matchShortcut` requires exactly one platform modifier (⌘ on macOS, Ctrl elsewhere) with the other up, ignores auto-repeat, and refuses to fire while focus is in an `input`/`textarea`/`select`/`contenteditable`. `useAppShortcuts` also stands down on its own while **any** modal is mounted (the shared stack in `src/components/useModal.ts`: every `ConfirmDialog`, the add-printer dialog and the tour), so a screen's own confirmation owns the keyboard too. Platform-mod+P is `preventDefault`ed **always** (typing, modal open or not), so the webview's own print dialog of the app UI can never open; Ctrl/⌘+P applies the same `printBlocker` rule as the Print button, and the labels say what the handlers do (`printFolder` = "Add a folder to the job", `cancel` = "Cancel the current or next job"). Verified at two levels: component tests dispatch synthetic events at jsdom, and `e2e/specs/home.e2e.ts` asserts the layer is bound to a **real** window in the packaged app — the case jsdom cannot catch — including a test that Home documents every shortcut it implements. |
| **NFR-041** | Keyboard operability is asserted rather than assumed: quick actions are real `<button>`s (checked in `home.e2e.ts`, not decorative `div`s); every modal (`ConfirmDialog`, add-printer, first-run tour) goes through `useModalFocus` — initial focus, Tab/Shift+Tab trap, Escape (topmost modal only), focus restore — and is portalled over the whole window with the app root `inert`; disabled Settings rows use a disabled, `inert` `<fieldset>` so their controls leave the tab order; the Print Job list keeps focus across reorder and remove; and the shortcut layer above means no primary action requires a pointer. |
| **NFR-042** | Every focusable primitive paints a focus ring via `.mp-focus`, asserted per component (`Switch`, `Checkbox`, `Select` test suites) rather than left to a global stylesheet. The ≥3:1 contrast figure itself is still manual. |
| **NFR-043** | Accessible names asserted across the primitives (`Checkbox`, `Select`, `Switch`, `Input`, `Kbd` — including a spoken alternative for glyph-only keys) and at screen level: Print Job copies/page range/option groups, the add-by-IP fields, every profile-editor field (named by its caption, described by its error, `aria-invalid`), the Settings engine fields, and per-job queue actions ("Cancel report.pdf"). |
| **NFR-044** | Semantics rather than styling: `ConfirmDialog`, the add-printer dialog and the tour are labelled `role="dialog"` + `aria-modal`; `Switch`, `Checkbox` and `Kbd` expose their native semantics; `<html lang>` follows the UI locale; loading/empty notices and the About update result are live regions; Home's recent rows include the job status in their name. Screen-reader smoke testing remains manual. |
| **NFR-045** | State is never carried by colour alone: `Segmented` exposes selection through `aria-checked`, `Checkbox` reports indeterminate as `mixed`, Board cards print their status, and the selected printer/profile rows carry `aria-current`. Token contrast (text ≥4.5:1, control outlines ≥3:1, text on accent ≥4.5:1, both themes) is asserted by `src/styles/tokens.test.ts`. |
| **NFR-061** | **Newly met.** `#![deny(missing_docs)]` in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` and `shell-ext-win/src/lib.rs`: an undocumented public item is a compile error, so the bar is held by every `cargo build`/`clippy`/`test` in CI rather than by review. Doc comments on `specta`-exported types also flow into `src/ipc/bindings.ts` as JSDoc. |
| **NFR-071** | `src-tauri/src/platform/{windows.rs, cups.rs, macos/}`. |
| **NFR-081** | `logging::Policy` — daily + size roll, swept at startup and on every roll by `retain_days` (14) and `retain_files` (7), whichever bites first. |
| **NFR-006** | `release.yml` fails a Windows installer over 20 MiB (15 MiB until 2026-10-10: the round-3 render worker, SVG stack, two Explorer DLLs and LibreOffice/HEIF install recipes took the x64 installer to 17.08 MiB and ARM64 to 15.49 MiB); the ARM64 installer measured 13.48 MiB on 2026-10-10. The x64 size is reported by every release build. |
| **NFR-020** | The per-user NSIS installer (`installMode: "currentUser"`) installs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pluryprint` and registers the Explorer command under `HKCU` only. Verified on Windows 11 24H2 ARM64 from a medium-integrity session with UAC on: no elevation prompt, nothing under `HKLM`. Installing LibreOffice from the dependency dialog is the one action that asks for administrator approval, and the dialog says so first. |

### Not met, or unverified

| ID | Reality |
|---|---|
| **NFR-001 … NFR-005, NFR-007, NFR-008** | No performance measurement of any kind: no `benches/` directory, no `criterion`, no RAM assertion. The macOS `.dmg` is not measured, and there is no sparse package. |
| **NFR-021** | Nothing is code-signed (no Authenticode, no Developer ID), by decision ([ADR-0011](../adr/0011-release-channel.md)). |
| **NFR-022** | *Met on both sides, not yet exercised by a real update (0.0.1 preview, published on 2026-10-10, is the first release):* the app refuses unsigned or wrongly-signed updates (`UpdateSignatureInvalid`; unit-tested mapping, and checked by hand against a one-byte-tampered artifact served locally), and `release.yml` signs every updater artifact, then verifies each signature against the key compiled into the app and checks that a tampered copy fails before the draft is finished. |
| **NFR-027** | No gitleaks scan. The only secret in use is the updater key, read by `release.yml` from GitHub Secrets. |
| **NFR-040** | No axe-core, no Playwright. WCAG AA is approached through the per-component assertions listed above, not through an automated conformance scan. |
| **NFR-050** | Neither the ESLint rule nor the (non-existent) Rust attribute is in place; externalisation is enforced by review. |
| **NFR-051, NFR-052, NFR-053** | See the inline notes: no ICU, no gendered forms, adding a language touches code, no expansion testing. |
| **NFR-060** | Gated, but with `cargo llvm-cov` rather than tarpaulin, and the TS thresholds sit below the 60% target as a regression gate. |
| **NFR-064** | No reproducibility verification. |
| **NFR-065** | No `cargo audit` / `pnpm audit` workflow. |
| **NFR-070** | All four targets are built by `release.yml`, but no Intel Mac runs the tests, and there is no universal macOS binary. |
