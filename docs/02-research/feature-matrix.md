# Feature Matrix

> **TL;DR** — A feature-by-feature comparison of Pluryprint (MVP and v1.0) against the major commercial and open-source batch-printing tools. The matrix shows where the market leaders dominate (format breadth, polished GUIs), where they all fall short (modern Windows shell integration), and where Pluryprint chooses to focus.

## Legend

## Reading the Matrix

A few things to notice when scanning the table:

### Where commercial leaders dominate

- **Format breadth.** Print Conductor and FolderMill (sharing fCoder's renderer) cover 90+ formats. We will not match this at MVP; we should not pretend we will.
- **Polish in advanced print options.** N-up, multi-mode collate, watermarks, and separator pages are all features the commercial tools have iterated on for over a decade.
- **Automation surface.** Batch & Print Pro's email + cloud + service combination is uniquely powerful.

### Where every competitor falls short

- **Modern Windows 11 context menu.** Not a single competitor — commercial or OSS — ships an `IExplorerCommand`-based top-level entry. They all live as separate windows users have to launch and then drag files into.
- **No 15-file workaround.** None of them ships a fix for the cap, because none of them is integrated into the shell to begin with.
- **Open source + multi-format + active maintenance.** This intersection is empty in the OSS column.

### Where Pluryprint MVP commits

- Free, GPLv3, OSS.
- Modern + legacy context menu integration.
- The file formats users batch-print 95% of the time (PDF, Office, images, text/MD, HTML).
- Core print options (duplex, color, paper, orientation, copies, page range, basic collate).
- Single-job print mode (ordering correctness).
- Basic CLI.
- Auto-update via signed Tauri updater.
- ARM64 from day one.

### Where Pluryprint v1.0 closes the gap

- Profiles, file-type routing, separator pages, watermarks, n-up, file-list import, full CLI.
- Multi-printer load balancing.
- Hot folders.
- Plugin API for the long tail of formats (CAD, email, etc.).

### Where Pluryprint deliberately says no

- Email monitor (POP3/IMAP/OAuth complexity for a niche use case).
- Cloud folder monitor (Dropbox/Drive — out of scope, privacy-first).
- Barcode watermarks (use a dedicated label tool).
- Page text matching as a *core* feature (plugin only).
- Linux support in the official build (welcomed as a community fork; the Rust core is portable, the shell integration layer is not).

## Format Coverage Detail

Because the comparison table compresses "multi-format input" into a single cell, here is the explicit breakdown for MVP and v1.0:

| Format family | MVP | v1.0 | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PDF (PDF 1.4–2.0, PDF/A) | ✓ | ✓ | `pdfium` (preferred) or `mupdf` (license fallback). Never Adobe Reader. |
| Microsoft Office (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX) | Partial | ✓ | Prefer headless LibreOffice if installed. Optional Office Interop fallback when Office is detected. |
| Legacy Office (DOC, XLS, PPT) | Partial | ✓ | Same path as modern Office. |
| Plain text (TXT) | ✓ | ✓ | Native renderer. |
| Markdown (MD) | ✓ | ✓ | Rendered to HTML, then printed via WebView2. |
| HTML / XHTML | ✓ | ✓ | Via WebView2 (Windows) or WKWebView (macOS). |
| RTF | ✗ | ✓ | Via headless LibreOffice. |
| CSV | Partial | ✓ | As tabular text or via spreadsheet engine. |
| JPEG, PNG, TIFF, BMP, GIF, WebP | ✓ | ✓ | `image-rs`. |
| SVG | ✗ | ✓ | `resvg`. |
| HEIC/HEIF | ✗ | Planned | Via `libheif` plugin. |
| EPUB | ✗ | Planned | v1+ plugin. |
| DjVu | ✗ | Planned | v1+ plugin. |
| AutoCAD DWG/DXF | ✗ | Planned | Plugin via `oda-libraries` or `dxf-rs`. |
| 3D (STEP/STL) | ✗ | ✗ | Out of scope — niche use case. |
| Email (EML/MSG/PST) | ✗ | Planned | Plugin. |
| Archives (ZIP/7z/RAR) | ✗ | Planned | Auto-extract and recurse. |
| Zebra ZPL | ✗ | Planned | Plugin (label printers). |
