## How this documentation is organized

We follow a **numbered-folder** convention for ordering and a flat hierarchy inside each folder. Cross-references use relative links so the docs work both on disk and on GitHub. ADRs follow the [Michael Nygard ADR template](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions): `Status`, `Context`, `Decision`, `Consequences`.

For changes to architectural decisions, **add a new ADR** that supersedes the old one rather than rewriting history.

## Status

This project is **pre-alpha · M1 (Print Core) largely delivered**. There is real production code behind most of these pages: a print engine, a persistent queue, profiles, settings, a headless CLI, and the Explorer/Finder context-menu handlers. There is also work that is still specification only — notably the installer and the download-and-install half of the updater.

[**Roadmap → Milestones**](./06-roadmap/milestones.md) is the single source of truth for what is delivered and what is open; per-requirement status lives in the `Status` column of [Functional Requirements](./03-requirements/functional-requirements.md). Those two documents are deliberately the only place that tracks status, so it cannot drift in three directions at once.

Expect rough edges; expect change. The locked decisions in the table above are stable.

## License of this documentation

The documentation in this folder is released under the same license as the code: **[AGPL-3.0](../LICENSE)**.
