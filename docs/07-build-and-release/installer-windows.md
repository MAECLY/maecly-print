# Installer (Windows)

> **TL;DR.** [ADR-0006](../adr/0006-installer-inno-setup.md) accepted **Inno Setup 6 + a Sparse MSIX package** as the Windows install story. **That decision is not implemented.** `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` packages with **NSIS** today (`bundle.windows.nsis`, `installMode: "currentUser"`), `installers/windows/` contains nothing but a `.gitkeep`, and there is no `.iss` file, no `AppxManifest.xml` and no `build.ps1` anywhere in the tree. This document describes the real state first, then keeps the ADR-0006 design as the specification to build against.

## Status: an open contradiction

| Claim | Reality |
|---|---|
| ADR-0006 (Accepted, 2026-05-03) selects Inno Setup as the primary installer, explicitly rejecting NSIS as "quirky … less polished" | `tauri.conf.json` configures `bundle.windows.nsis` and nothing else. NSIS is what a `pnpm tauri build` produces. |
| ADR-0006 requires a post-install PowerShell step registering a Sparse MSIX via `Add-AppxPackage -Register -ExternalLocation` | No sparse package exists. `installers/windows/sparse-msix/` was never created. |
| ADR-0006 requires `installers/windows/inno-setup.iss` + `build.ps1` | Neither file exists. `installers/windows/` holds a single `.gitkeep`. |
| ADR-0005 / ADR-0006 assume a C++ COM DLL named `shell-ext-win.dll` / `PluryprintShellExt.dll` | The extension is a Rust `cdylib` and the built artifact is **`shell_ext_win.dll`** (underscores — `[lib] name = "shell_ext_win"`). |
| ADR-0006 fixes the app CLSID as `{A1B2C3D4-E5F6-7890-ABCD-EF1234567890}` in draft snippets | The real CLSID, in `shell-ext-win/src/clsid.rs`, is **`{B269B8DC-044F-4D65-8F1E-8F20A2E653EA}`**. |

**Decided (2026-10-09): option 2.** [ADR-0008](../adr/0008-installer-nsis-per-user.md) supersedes ADR-0006. The Windows installer is Tauri's per-user NSIS bundle, with signed updater artifacts (`createUpdaterArtifacts`), because `tauri-plugin-updater` installs updates by running that same setup. The sparse-MSIX identity remains open and is tracked in ADR-0008. The two options as they were weighed:

1. **Implement ADR-0006** — write the `.iss`, the sparse MSIX and `build.ps1`, and stop using Tauri's NSIS bundler for release artifacts; or
2. **Supersede ADR-0006** with a new ADR that accepts NSIS (Tauri's bundler already produces a per-user NSIS installer, which satisfies the no-admin constraint) and specifies how the sparse-MSIX identity requirement from ADR-0005 is met alongside it — that requirement does not go away, because `shell-ext-win/res/shellext.manifest` already embeds an `<msix>` element that is meaningless without a matching package.

ADRs are not rewritten, they are superseded. Do not edit ADR-0006 to match the code.

Whichever way it goes, one constraint binds both options: `SumatraPDF.exe` is **not committed**. Any packaging job must run `scripts/fetch-sumatrapdf.ps1` first, or `bundle.resources` (`resources/sumatrapdf/*`) copies only a `README.md` and every print job on the installed app fails with `DependencyMissing`.

## Packaging a Windows installer (current procedure)

Three steps, in this order, on a Windows machine of the installer's architecture (or with `-Arch` for the other one):

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\fetch-sumatrapdf.ps1 -Arch arm64   # or x64
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\build-shell-ext.ps1 -Arch arm64    # or x64
pnpm tauri build                      # PR/CI builds: --config src-tauri/tauri.ci.conf.json
```

- `fetch-sumatrapdf.ps1` puts the SumatraPDF build for that architecture, with its licence files, in `src-tauri/resources/sumatrapdf/`.
- `build-shell-ext.ps1` builds `shell_ext_win.dll` and copies it to `src-tauri/windows/`. The installer hooks (`src-tauri/windows/installer-hooks.nsh`, wired through `bundle.windows.nsis.installerHooks`) refuse to build an installer without it.
- The result is `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/Pluryprint_<version>_<arch>-setup.exe`, per user (`installMode: "currentUser"`), installing to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pluryprint\` with its uninstall entry under HKCU. No MSI is built (`bundle.targets` has no `msi`).

What the hooks register, all under `HKCU\Software\Classes`:

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `CLSID\{B269B8DC-044F-4D65-8F1E-8F20A2E653EA}\InprocServer32` | `(Default)` = `<install dir>\shell_ext_win.dll`, `ThreadingModel` = `Apartment` |
| `*\shell\Pluryprint` and `Directory\shell\Pluryprint` | `ExplorerCommandHandler` = the CLSID, `MultiSelectModel` = `Player`, `Icon` = `pluryprint.exe,0` |

### Verified on Windows 11 ARM64 (24H2, 2026-10-10)

With UAC **enabled** and the installer run from a non-elevated, medium-integrity session (`whoami /groups` = *Medium Mandatory Level*, not an administrator token):

- `Pluryprint_0.0.1_arm64-setup.exe /S` exits 0 in about 7 s with no elevation; files land in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pluryprint\` (`pluryprint.exe`, `pluryprint-cli.exe`, `shell_ext_win.dll`, `uninstall.exe`, `resources\sumatrapdf\` with the ARM64 `SumatraPDF.exe` and its licence files); the CLSID and verbs exist under HKCU and nothing under HKLM. `uninstall.exe /S` exits 0 and removes the keys.
- The classic context menu that Explorer builds for a `.pdf` (`IContextMenu` from the file's folder) lists **Pluryprint**, and its sub-command *Print 1 file* put the file into the paused default queue as a job named `e2e-sample.pdf`.

One limit found on the way: when Explorer itself runs **elevated** (UAC turned off, as on the test VM by default), Windows ignores per-user COM registrations for shell extensions, so the HKCU-registered handler is never created and the entry does not appear. That is the documented behaviour for elevated processes, not something a per-user installer can change. Machines with UAC on, the Windows default, are not affected.

That is the Windows 10 verb shape from `shell-ext-win/README.md`: the menu entry appears on Windows 10 and in the Windows 11 classic menu (*Show more options*, Shift+F10), for any number of selected items. Uninstall deletes the three keys. The Windows 11 top-level entry needs a sparse package signed with a trusted certificate, and waits for the code-signing certificate (ADR-0008, Risks).

## What actually ships today

`bundle` in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`:

```json
"bundle": {
  "active": true,
  "targets": ["nsis", "app", "dmg", "deb", "rpm", "appimage"],
  "resources": ["resources/sumatrapdf/*"],
  "publisher": "Maecly",
  "windows": {
    "nsis": {
      "installMode": "currentUser",
      "installerHooks": "windows/installer-hooks.nsh"
    }
  },
  "createUpdaterArtifacts": true
}
```

- `installMode: "currentUser"` is what keeps the no-admin requirement (NFR-020) satisfied: a per-user install under `%LOCALAPPDATA%`, `HKCU` only.
- `targets` is an explicit list without `msi`. The bundler builds only the entries that apply to the host, so a Windows build produces the per-user NSIS `setup.exe` and nothing else. It used to be `"all"`, which also built a per-machine WiX MSI (Program Files, elevation) next to it. Installing that MSI and later updating through the NSIS-based `latest.json` left two installs and two Start-menu entries, which contradicts [ADR-0008](../adr/0008-installer-nsis-per-user.md). `fr_083_no_per_machine_msi_is_bundled` guards the list.
- The crate has two binaries, `pluryprint` (the app) and `pluryprint-cli` (`src/bin/pluryprint-cli.rs`, the console-subsystem CLI front end scripts wait on). Tauri's bundler packages every binary of the crate, so the NSIS installer is expected to place `pluryprint-cli.exe` next to `pluryprint.exe`; **verify this on the first Windows build.** Neither is added to `PATH` yet.
- `plugins.updater` and `createUpdaterArtifacts` are set: the NSIS setup is signed for the updater, and `tauri-plugin-updater` installs an update by running that same setup in `passive` mode (see [auto-update-flow.md](./auto-update-flow.md)).
- `installerHooks` points at `src-tauri/windows/installer-hooks.nsh`, the one hooks file: besides registering the context menu (above), its `NSIS_HOOK_PREINSTALL` takes over an install made under the former name, MaeclyPrint (see [ADR-0009](../adr/0009-rename-to-pluryprint.md)). The app moves the user data itself on first launch.
  - **Per-user install (NSIS, HKCU).** The hook reads the old folder from the unquoted default value of `HKCU\Software\Maecly\MaeclyPrint`, falling back to the unquoted `InstallLocation` and then to the uninstaller's folder. It runs `uninstall.exe /S _?=<folder>`, so it waits for the uninstaller (user data is kept). Only when the uninstaller exits `0` and `maeclyprint.exe` is gone does it delete what registration remains: the `Uninstall\MaeclyPrint` and `HKCU\Software\Maecly\MaeclyPrint` keys, the `*\shell\MaeclyPrint` and `Directory\shell\MaeclyPrint` verbs, and the shortcuts. If the uninstaller fails, the old install keeps its registration, so it can still be removed from "Apps & features".
  - **Per-machine install (the WiX MSI that builds made before `c1466b4`, HKLM).** The setup runs without elevation, so it cannot remove this install by itself. It finds the MSI by `DisplayName`/`Publisher`, asks the user, and runs `msiexec /x <product code> /passive`, which asks for administrator approval (UAC). A silent install, a "No" or a declined UAC prompt leave the MSI install in place, and the setup log says so. The user then removes it from "Apps & features".
  - `bundle_identity.rs` checks the hook's structure and compiles it with `makensis -WX` when `makensis` is installed. **Verify the hook on the Windows VM** with a MaeclyPrint build installed, both per user and from the MSI.
- Nothing is code-signed. See [ci-cd.md](./ci-cd.md) § *What does not exist yet*.

Everything from here down is **the ADR-0006 design, unimplemented**. Treat every file path in it as a path to be created.

## Why Inno Setup (ADR-0006 rationale)

Inno Setup 6 was chosen over alternatives for these reasons:

| Tool | Verdict | Why / why not |
|---|---|---|
| **Inno Setup** | Chosen | Free for commercial use, Pascal-like scripting (full control), single self-extracting `.exe`, mature, no admin install supported, large ecosystem of examples. |
| WiX Toolset / MSI | Rejected | MSI requires admin for system install; per-user MSI is convoluted; XML scripting is verbose; Windows Installer service interactions unpredictable for shell extensions. |
| MSIX (full) | Rejected as primary | Requires Microsoft Store association or sideloading flags; restricts what installers can do; AppContainer constraints break some Win32 print API calls. We use **Sparse** MSIX as a complement, not a replacement. |
| NSIS | Rejected | Capable but with smaller mindshare for our specific shell-extension + sparse-MSIX combo. |
| Custom PowerShell installer | Rejected | Antivirus heuristics flag PS-based installers more often; UX is worse. |

## Inno Setup script structure

The script lives at `installers/windows/inno-setup.iss`. Below is the section-by-section structure with the key directives. The full `.iss` is generated via the build script and pinned in the repo for reproducibility.

### `[Setup]` section

```iss
[Setup]
AppId={{B72E6F3A-1C4F-4C8E-9B62-3A4E5D6F7A8B}

ArchitecturesAllowed=x64 arm64
MinVersion=10.0.19041
UninstallDisplayIcon={app}\pluryprint.exe
UninstallDisplayName=Pluryprint {#MyAppVersion}
SignTool=signtool
```

Notes:

- **`PrivilegesRequired=lowest`** plus the override allowance lets the user install per-user without admin (default) or system-wide if they elevate.
- **`MinVersion=10.0.19041`** is Windows 10 20H1. Lower versions get a clear "unsupported" dialog rather than a partial install.
- **`AppId` GUID** never changes across versions; it's how Windows recognizes upgrades.
- **`SignTool=signtool`** is configured globally in Inno Setup options to invoke our `signtool` wrapper that signs every produced `.exe`.

### `[Files]` section

Source: "..\..\CHANGELOG.md"; DestDir: "{app}"; Flags: ignoreversion
Source: "sparse-msix\Pluryprint.msix"; DestDir: "{app}\sparse-msix"; Flags: ignoreversion; Check: IsWindows11
```

Notes:

- `signonce` ensures we sign each binary exactly once during install (we already signed during build, this is belt-and-suspenders for cases where Inno Setup repacks).
- The shell extension DLL gets `regserver` only as a safety net; the canonical registration is via the Sparse MSIX (Win 11) or HKCU registry entries (Win 10), set in `[Registry]`.
- `Check: IsWindows11` skips the MSIX file on Win 10. `IsWindows11` is a custom Pascal function (see [Code] section).

### `[Registry]` section

For Win 10 fallback (when Sparse MSIX is not deployed), we register a classic `IContextMenu` extension via HKCU:

```iss
[Registry]
; CLSID for the in-proc COM server
Root: HKCU; Subkey: "Software\Classes\CLSID\{{B269B8DC-044F-4D65-8F1E-8F20A2E653EA}}"; ValueType: string; ValueData: "Pluryprint Shell Extension"; Flags: uninsdeletekey
Root: HKCU; Subkey: "Software\Classes\CLSID\{{B269B8DC-044F-4D65-8F1E-8F20A2E653EA}}\InprocServer32"; ValueType: string; ValueData: "{app}\shell_ext_win.dll"; Flags: uninsdeletekey
Root: HKCU; Subkey: "Software\Classes\CLSID\{{B269B8DC-044F-4D65-8F1E-8F20A2E653EA}}\InprocServer32"; ValueType: string; ValueName: "ThreadingModel"; ValueData: "Apartment"

; Attach to "AllFileSystemObjects" so the verb appears for any file/folder selection
Root: HKCU; Subkey: "Software\Classes\AllFileSystemObjects\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers\Pluryprint"; ValueType: string; ValueData: "{{B269B8DC-044F-4D65-8F1E-8F20A2E653EA}}"; Flags: uninsdeletekey

; Register the application URL handler for the pluryprint:// scheme (used by IPC handoff)
Root: HKCU; Subkey: "Software\Classes\pluryprint"; ValueType: string; ValueData: "URL:Pluryprint Protocol"; Flags: uninsdeletekey
Root: HKCU; Subkey: "Software\Classes\pluryprint"; ValueType: string; ValueName: "URL Protocol"; ValueData: ""
Root: HKCU; Subkey: "Software\Classes\pluryprint\shell\open\command"; ValueType: string; ValueData: """{app}\pluryprint.exe"" --uri ""%1"""
```

Notes:

- All entries are `HKCU\Software\Classes\` (per-user). No `HKLM` writes; no admin needed.
- `uninsdeletekey` ensures the key is removed on uninstall.
- The CLSID GUID `{B269B8DC-044F-4D65-8F1E-8F20A2E653EA}` is fixed across versions; it's the contract with Windows. Its single source of truth is `shell-ext-win/src/clsid.rs` (`CLSID_PLURYPRINT_COMMAND`), which documents the three places it must agree in. Never regenerate it: an already-installed machine keeps the old CLSID registered and the menu entry simply stops appearing.
- Note the Win 10 fallback shape the crate documents is a **verb** under `HKCU\Software\Classes\*\shell\Pluryprint\ExplorerCommandHandler`, i.e. an `IExplorerCommand` handler, not the `shellex\ContextMenuHandlers` `IContextMenu` shape sketched above. The crate implements `IExplorerCommand` only. Whoever writes the real registration must reconcile this before shipping.

### `[Icons]` section

```iss
[Icons]
Name: "{group}\Pluryprint"; Filename: "{app}\pluryprint.exe"
Name: "{group}\Uninstall Pluryprint"; Filename: "{uninstallexe}"
Name: "{userdesktop}\Pluryprint"; Filename: "{app}\pluryprint.exe"; Tasks: desktopicon
```

```iss
[Tasks]
Name: "desktopicon"; Description: "Create a &desktop icon"; GroupDescription: "Additional shortcuts:"; Flags: unchecked
```

### `[Run]` section — Sparse MSIX deployment

```iss
[Run]
Filename: "powershell.exe"; \
  Parameters: "-NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command ""Add-AppxPackage -Path '{app}\sparse-msix\Pluryprint.msix' -ExternalLocation '{app}'"""; \
  Flags: runhidden waituntilterminated; \
  Check: IsWindows11; \
  StatusMsg: "Registering modern shell integration..."

Filename: "{app}\pluryprint.exe"; Description: "{cm:LaunchProgram,Pluryprint}"; Flags: postinstall skipifsilent nowait
```

The `-ExternalLocation` flag is what makes this a **Sparse** package — the MSIX manifest declares files that live outside the package, in the main install directory. This avoids duplicating the binary while still giving us MSIX identity.

### `[UninstallRun]` section

```iss
[UninstallRun]
Filename: "powershell.exe"; \
  Parameters: "-NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command ""Get-AppxPackage -Name 'Pluryprint' | Remove-AppxPackage"""; \
  Flags: runhidden waituntilterminated; \
  RunOnceId: "RemoveSparseMsix"
```

### `[Code]` section — custom Pascal logic

```pascal
[Code]
function IsWindows11(): Boolean;
var
  Major, Minor, Build: Cardinal;
begin
  GetWindowsVersionEx(Major, Minor, Build);
  Result := (Major = 10) and (Build >= 22000);
end;

function InitializeSetup(): Boolean;
begin
  Result := True;
  // Warn if optional dependencies missing
  if not CheckLibreOfficeInstalled() then
    MsgBox('LibreOffice is not installed. Office documents will be skipped. ' +
           'Install LibreOffice from https://www.libreoffice.org/ to enable Office support.',
           mbInformation, MB_OK);
end;

function CheckLibreOfficeInstalled(): Boolean;
var
  Found: Boolean;
begin
  Found := RegKeyExists(HKLM, 'SOFTWARE\LibreOffice\UNO\InstallPath') or
           RegKeyExists(HKCU, 'SOFTWARE\LibreOffice\UNO\InstallPath');
  Result := Found;
end;

procedure DeinitializeUninstall();
var
  AppDataPath: String;
begin
  // Optional: prompt user to remove their data
  AppDataPath := ExpandConstant('{userappdata}\Pluryprint');
  if DirExists(AppDataPath) then
  begin
    if MsgBox('Remove your Pluryprint profiles and logs at ' + AppDataPath + '?', mbConfirmation, MB_YESNO) = IDYES then
      DelTree(AppDataPath, True, True, True);
  end;
end;
```

## Sparse MSIX package

### Why "sparse"

A sparse MSIX package contains a manifest only — no payload. Files are declared with paths that point outside the package, into the main install directory. The package's only purpose is to give the shell extension DLL a **package identity**, which Windows 11's modern shell (the new File Explorer) requires for `IExplorerCommand` registration.

Without identity:

- Win 11's modern File Explorer ignores the extension.
- Only the legacy `IContextMenu` path works (Win 10 style), which doesn't surface in the new modern command bar.

The CLSID `B269B8DC-...` matches the one in the Inno Setup `[Registry]` section. They must agree.

This separation matters: install-area is read-only after install (we never write there at runtime); user-area is everything that survives uninstall unless the user opts in to wipe.

## Registry surface

Complete list of the registry writes the designed installer would perform (all under `HKCU\Software\Classes\`). Nothing writes them today; during development the registration is manual.

| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CLSID\{B269B8DC-...}` | Friendly name of the COM server |
| `CLSID\{B269B8DC-...}\InprocServer32` | DLL path + threading model |
| `AllFileSystemObjects\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers\Pluryprint` | Hooks the verb into Win 10 File Explorer |
| `pluryprint` | URL protocol handler for `pluryprint://` IPC scheme |
| `pluryprint\shell\open\command` | Command to launch when URL is invoked |

Plus a single key under `HKCU\Software\Pluryprint`:

| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `HKCU\Software\Pluryprint\Settings` | App-level settings (channel, language, etc.) — written by app at runtime, not by installer |

Inno Setup's standard `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\<AppId>_is1` key is also written automatically (for Add/Remove Programs).

## Dependency detection

> Still part of the unimplemented design. The installer that would run these
> checks does not exist. The app itself already does the runtime half: a job
> that needs a missing converter pauses with a remediation message (FR-058,
> see [supported-formats.md](../03-requirements/supported-formats.md)), and
> the Print Job screen shows it for the files the user selected.

The installer would **detect** but never **install** optional runtimes:

| Dependency | Detection method | If missing |
|---|---|---|
| WebView2 Runtime | `HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\Clients\{F3017226-FE2A-4295-8BDF-00C3A9A7E4C5}\pv` | Hard error: WebView2 is required (preinstalled on Win 11; bootstrap link shown for Win 10). |
| LibreOffice | `HKLM` or `HKCU` `SOFTWARE\LibreOffice\UNO\InstallPath` | Soft warning: Office, OpenDocument, TXT and RTF jobs will pause until it is installed. |
| Pandoc | `where.exe pandoc` returns 0 | Soft warning: Markdown jobs will pause until it is installed. |
| Chromium / Edge | Edge is preinstalled; check `where.exe msedge` | Soft warning only if Edge was removed: HTML and Markdown jobs pause. |
| HEIF Image Extensions | WIC decoder lookup (the app does this at conversion time) | Soft warning: HEIC/HEIF jobs pause with a Microsoft Store link. |

**ImageMagick is deliberately not on this list.** Image conversion is in-process (the pure-Rust `image` crate), so there is nothing to detect; an earlier draft of this table listed it.

We **never** silently install third-party software. Every install action is the user's choice.

## Uninstall flow

When the user runs the uninstaller (`unins000.exe`):

1. **Stop running app:** if `pluryprint.exe` is running, prompt the user to close it (or wait + retry).
2. **Remove sparse MSIX:** `Remove-AppxPackage -Name Pluryprint`. If this fails (rare), log and continue — orphan MSIX entries are harmless.
3. **Unregister shell extension DLL:** `regsvr32 /u shell_ext_win.dll` (no-op if Inno Setup's `regserver` flag wasn't used, but defensive).
4. **Delete registry entries:** all `HKCU\Software\Classes\` entries listed in `[Registry]` (Inno Setup handles via `uninsdeletekey`).
5. **Delete install directory:** Inno Setup default behavior.
6. **Prompt for user data:** ask whether to delete `%APPDATA%\Maecly\Pluryprint` and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Maecly\Pluryprint`. Default is **no** (preserve user data).
7. **Refresh shell:** broadcast `WM_SETTINGCHANGE` so File Explorer re-reads context menu registrations.

After a clean uninstall (with user data wiped), `regedit` and `Process Monitor` should find zero Pluryprint references. **This is not tested anywhere.** There is no installer test job in `ci.yml`, and there cannot be one until an installer exists; today it is a manual QA item on the release checklist.

## Build script

**This file does not exist.** `installers/windows/build.ps1` would be the single entrypoint. It would:

0. Run `scripts/fetch-sumatrapdf.ps1 -Arch <x64|arm64>` for the installer's architecture (or verify a previous run left `SumatraPDF.exe`, `LICENSE.txt` and a `SOURCE.txt` naming that architecture in `src-tauri/resources/sumatrapdf/`). Skipping this is the difference between a working installer and one whose every print job fails.
1. Validate that `pluryprint.exe`, `shell_ext_win.dll` and `SumatraPDF.exe` exist in expected locations — note the DLL comes out of `shell-ext-win/target/<triple>/release/`, a *separate* target directory from the app's, because the crate is not a workspace member.
2. Read the version from `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`.
3. Generate the sparse MSIX with `MakeAppx.exe` from the Windows SDK.
4. Sign the MSIX with the EV cert (release builds) or self-signed cert (nightly builds) — neither certificate exists yet; see [code-signing.md](./code-signing.md).
5. Invoke `iscc.exe inno-setup.iss /DMyAppVersion=<version>`.
6. Verify the produced `setup.exe` is signed: `signtool verify /pa /v setup.exe`.
7. Output the SHA-256 of the final installer for the release manifest.

```powershell
# installers/windows/build.ps1 (excerpt)
param(
  [Parameter(Mandatory)] [string]$Version,
  [ValidateSet('release', 'nightly')] [string]$Channel = 'release'
)

$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'

# 1. Validate prerequisites
$required = @('iscc.exe', 'MakeAppx.exe', 'SignTool.exe')
foreach ($tool in $required) {
  if (-not (Get-Command $tool -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)) {
    throw "Required tool not found in PATH: $tool"
  }
}

# 2. Build sparse MSIX
$msixPath = "sparse-msix/Pluryprint.msix"
& MakeAppx.exe pack /d "sparse-msix/" /p $msixPath /nv | Out-Host
if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { throw "MakeAppx failed" }

# 3. Sign MSIX
$cert = if ($Channel -eq 'release') { $env:EV_CERT_THUMBPRINT } else { $env:NIGHTLY_CERT_THUMBPRINT }
& SignTool.exe sign /sha1 $cert /fd SHA256 /td SHA256 /tr "http://timestamp.digicert.com" $msixPath
if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { throw "MSIX signing failed" }

# 4. Build setup.exe
& iscc.exe "inno-setup.iss" "/DMyAppVersion=$Version" "/DChannel=$Channel"
if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { throw "Inno Setup compile failed" }

# 5. Verify signature
$setupPath = "output/Pluryprint-Setup-$Version.exe"
& SignTool.exe verify /pa /v $setupPath
if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { throw "Setup verification failed" }

# 6. Emit hash
$hash = (Get-FileHash $setupPath -Algorithm SHA256).Hash
"setup.exe SHA-256: $hash" | Out-Host
$hash | Out-File "$setupPath.sha256" -Encoding ASCII -NoNewline
```

## Reproducibility

Two builds from the same commit must produce byte-identical `setup.exe`. To achieve this:

- Inno Setup's `Compression=lzma2/ultra64` is deterministic given the same input file order.
- Files are listed in `[Files]` in a fixed order.
- The build script enforces UTC timestamps via `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` env var (Inno Setup 6.2+ supports this).
- Sparse MSIX is built with `MakeAppx /nv` (no version stamp randomness).
- Signing introduces a timestamp; we accept that signed binaries differ in the timestamp byte range only. The unsigned binary is the bit-for-bit reproducible artifact.

**Not verified.** CI does not build twice and diff the results; NFR-064 has no automated check today. The intent is a double-build reproducibility job in the release pipeline whenever that pipeline is written.
