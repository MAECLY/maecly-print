# Tech Stack

> **TL;DR** — Pluryprint is built on **Tauri 2 + Rust + React (TypeScript)**. This combination gives us a small installer, fast cold start, low idle RAM, and a near-fully shared codebase across Windows and macOS — which is exactly what a context-menu-invoked utility needs. Updates install through Tauri's updater plugin with a minisign-signed manifest per channel on GitHub Releases; see [`auto-updater.md`](./auto-updater.md).

## 1. Stack at a glance

Everything in this table is declared in `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `shell-ext-win/Cargo.toml`, `package.json` or `tauri.conf.json`.

## 2. Why Tauri 2

Tauri 2 was selected after benchmarking five competing frameworks. The full comparison appears in [`../02-research/`](../02-research/), but the headline numbers driving the choice are:

| Stack             | Installer  | RAM idle    | Cold start | Auto-update           | Cross-platform        | Score |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | ----- |
| **Tauri 2**       | 5-10 MB    | 30-50 MB    | < 500 ms   | Built-in (MIT)        | ✓ Win/Mac/Linux       | 9/10  |
| Electron          | 80-150 MB  | 200-300 MB  | 1-2 s      | `autoUpdater` module  | ✓ but overkill        | 5/10  |
| .NET MAUI / Avalonia | ~50 MB  | 80-150 MB   | Fast       | Velopack / NetSparkle | ✓ Avalonia only       | 6/10  |
| Wails (Go)        | 5-15 MB    | 20-40 MB    | < 500 ms   | None built-in         | ✓ smaller community   | 6.5/10|
| Flutter Desktop   | 50-100 MB  | 100-150 MB  | Fast       | None built-in         | ✓ shell ext. awkward  | 4/10  |
| Qt / PySide6      | 100+ MB    | 80-150 MB   | Fast       | None built-in         | ✓ mature but verbose  | 5/10  |

### Why each metric matters for Pluryprint

- **Installer size.** Pluryprint is invoked by people who right-click a file and expect the dialog to appear instantly. Bundle bloat hurts the install experience and slows updates.
- **RAM idle.** The app may sit in the tray (or be re-launched on every right-click). Electron's 250 MB baseline is unacceptable for a utility.
- **Cold start.** Right-click latency is perceived directly by users. Anything over ~700 ms feels broken.
- **Auto-update.** A polished updater is non-negotiable for a desktop app shipped outside an app store. Tauri ships one as a first-party MIT plugin; competitors require third-party glue.
- **Cross-platform.** macOS is on the roadmap (M5). A 95% shared codebase means the Mac port is a port, not a rewrite.

### Concrete Tauri 2 advantages

1. **Updater plugin, in use.** Tauri's signed-manifest updater installs updates per user once the user asks; the check reads the same manifest. Releases live on GitHub, so there is no update server to run ([ADR-0011](../adr/0011-release-channel.md)).
2. **System webview.** Uses WebView2 on Windows and WKWebView on macOS — no Chromium bundled. This is the source of the small installer and low RAM, and since round 3 the same web view also prints HTML, Markdown and text documents in a worker process ([ADR-0012](../adr/0012-system-web-view-renderer.md)).
3. **Rust backend.** Memory-safe, zero garbage-collection pauses, fast startup, excellent FFI for the COM DLL boundary, and a strong ecosystem (`tokio`, `serde`, `tracing`).
4. **Type-safe IPC.** `tauri::command` macros plus generated TypeScript bindings (`tauri-specta` or hand-rolled) make the React ↔ Rust boundary safe.
5. **First-class Windows support.** Tauri 2 fixed several Windows pain points from v1 (better installer story, MSIX support, mobile, capabilities system).
6. **Capabilities security model.** Tauri 2's permission system lets us narrow the webview's reachable IPC commands to a minimum.

## 3. Why Rust for the core

The Rust core handles file enumeration, format detection, conversion orchestration, queue management, IPC, the CLI, and the updater logic. It was chosen because:

- **Memory safety** in a process that ingests untrusted file paths and shells out to converters. A use-after-free in the print queue would be embarrassing.
- **Performance.** Enumerating thousands of files, dispatching conversions in parallel, and maintaining an IPC stream to the webview is throughput-bound. Rust + `tokio` excels here.
- **Single binary deployment.** Statically linked Rust binaries ship without a runtime — important for a utility that should never make the user "install Java" or ".NET Framework".
- **Ecosystem maturity.** Every crate the design needs exists and is mature — see the table below, which is the real list.
- **One language across the OS boundary.** The Windows shell extension is a Rust `cdylib` too, so the handoff contract (`shell-ext-win/src/handoff.rs` ↔ `src-tauri/src/cli/handoff.rs`) is written once in one language, and both sides resolve the handoff directory through the same `directories` call.

### Rust dependencies (direct, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`)

## 4. Why React + TypeScript for the UI

The frontend is a small SPA: a print dialog, a profile editor, a queue viewer, and a settings page. We chose React + TypeScript because:

- **Productivity.** Building rich form UIs in React with hooks and component libraries is fast.
- **TypeScript** catches IPC mismatches at compile time when paired with generated bindings.
- **Small, deliberate dependency set.** The runtime frontend has five packages, not fifty: React, React DOM, the two `@tauri-apps` bridges, `zustand` and `sonner`. UI primitives, forms, icons and IPC caching are hand-written, which is affordable at this app's size and keeps the bundle honest.
- **Testability.** `vitest` + `@testing-library/react` is a well-trodden path.

### Frontend dependencies

**Runtime (bundled):**

| Package                      | Purpose |
| ---------------------------- | ------- |
| `react`, `react-dom` 18.3    | UI runtime |
| `@tauri-apps/api` 2.1        | `invoke` + event bridge (used through the generated bindings) |
| `@tauri-apps/plugin-dialog`  | Native file picker |
| `zustand` 5                  | Cross-route state (queue, profiles, settings stores) |
| `sonner` 1.7                 | Toasts |

**Build / dev only:** `vite` 5, `typescript` 5.7, `tailwindcss` 3.4 + `postcss` + `autoprefixer`, `eslint` 9 (+ react, react-hooks, jsx-a11y, react-refresh plugins), `prettier`, `vitest` 2 + `@vitest/coverage-v8` + `jsdom`, `@testing-library/{react,jest-dom,user-event}`, `@wdio/*` 9 for e2e, `husky` + `lint-staged` + `@commitlint/*`, `@tauri-apps/cli`.

Packages named in earlier drafts and **not** used: `@radix-ui/*`, `react-hook-form`, `@tanstack/react-query`, `lucide-react`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `react-i18next`, `playwright`.

### Frontend conventions

- Styling is Tailwind for layout plus design tokens as CSS custom properties in `src/styles/tokens.css` (`--mp-*`), imported by `src/styles/globals.css`. Tailwind's `preflight` is disabled so the tokens own the base look. Fonts are bundled, never fetched.
- Localization lives in `src/i18n/` — a provider plus one JSON catalogue per screen, in `en` and `es`. No i18n runtime dependency.
- IPC goes through the generated `src/ipc/bindings.ts` (never hand-edited) and the `src/lib/ipc.ts` wrapper. No raw `invoke()` in components.
- State that crosses route boundaries lives in `zustand`. Anything component-local stays in `useState`.

## 5. Stacks we considered and rejected

### 5.1 Electron

**Pros:** ubiquitous, huge community, mature auto-updater (`electron-updater`), batteries-included.
**Cons:**
- Bundles Chromium → 80-150 MB installer.
- 200-300 MB RAM idle.
- Cold start in the 1-2 s range; unacceptable for a context-menu utility.
- Node.js in main process: extra GC pauses, weaker isolation story than Rust.
- Repeated security advisories for popular Electron apps suggest the surface area is large.

**Verdict:** rejected on installer size, RAM, and cold start.

### 5.2 .NET MAUI / Avalonia (C#)

**Pros:** strong tooling (Visual Studio, Rider), mature .NET BCL, native Win32 interop, decent cross-platform via Avalonia.
**Cons:**
- Self-contained .NET runtime adds 30-50 MB even after trimming.
- No first-party auto-updater. Velopack is good, but third-party.
- COM interop is doable but more friction than C++/Rust.
- macOS story (Avalonia) is less polished than Tauri's WKWebView path.

**Verdict:** rejected because no built-in updater and a bigger footprint than Tauri.

### 5.3 Wails (Go)

**Pros:** very small binaries, fast cold start, simple Go syntax, similar webview model to Tauri.
**Cons:**
- No built-in updater.
- Smaller community; fewer plugins, less battle-tested for shell extension integration.
- Go's GC is fine but adds latency variability that Rust avoids.

**Verdict:** rejected. Tauri is structurally similar but more featureful (updater, capabilities, mobile).

### 5.4 Flutter Desktop

**Pros:** beautiful UI, fast iteration, single codebase across mobile + desktop.
**Cons:**
- Renders its own widgets (Skia) → larger bundle, no native look-and-feel.
- No built-in auto-updater.
- Shell extension integration on Windows is awkward (no clean FFI to a C++ COM DLL).
- Dart ecosystem outside Google is thin for desktop concerns.

**Verdict:** rejected. Wrong fit for a "small native utility" target.

### 5.5 Qt / PySide6

**Pros:** mature, professional, exhaustive widgets, cross-platform.
**Cons:**
- LGPL dynamic linking adds compliance complexity.
- 100+ MB installer when bundled.
- Verbose to develop in compared to React.
- No built-in updater.

**Verdict:** rejected on installer size, LGPL friction, and verbosity.

### 5.6 Rust + egui / Slint (no webview)

**Pros:** smallest possible binary, fastest startup, no webview dependency.
**Cons:**
- Custom-rendered UIs feel non-native on Windows; accessibility (NVDA, narrator) is weaker.
- The print profile editor and dialog need rich form controls; building them in egui is a slog.
- Theming and dark-mode tracking is more work.

**Verdict:** rejected. Webview UX wins for form-heavy desktop utilities.

## 6. Toolchain and supported versions

| Tool          | Required version    |
| ------------- | ------------------- |
| Rust          | 1.78 stable+        |
| Node.js       | 20 LTS+             |
| pnpm          | 9.x (preferred over npm/yarn) |
| Tauri CLI     | 2.x                 |
| Visual Studio Build Tools | 2022 (Win)         |
| Windows SDK   | 10.0.22621.0+ (for WebView2 + COM)  |
| WebView2 Runtime | Evergreen (auto-installed by Win 11; bootstrapper for Win 10) |
| Xcode         | 15+ (Mac)           |

`package.json` pins the package manager (`pnpm@9.15.0`) and declares `engines.node >= 20`; both `Cargo.toml`s declare `rust-version = "1.78"`. There is **no `rust-toolchain.toml`** in the repo, so the Rust version CI uses is whatever `.github/workflows/ci.yml` installs — adding one is an open item (see [`security-model.md`](./security-model.md) §9). Inno Setup is not part of the toolchain; the Windows installer comes from Tauri's NSIS target.

- ADR [`0010-relicense-to-agpl-3.0`](../adr/0010-relicense-to-agpl-3.0.md) — license choice (AGPL-3.0, superseding [`0002-license-gplv3`](../adr/0002-license-gplv3.md)) that constrains some dependencies.
- ADR [`0004-auto-updater-tauri-builtin`](../adr/0004-auto-updater-tauri-builtin.md) — updater choice tied to Tauri. **The shipped build does not follow it**; the disagreement is tracked in [`auto-updater.md`](./auto-updater.md) §8 and needs a superseding ADR or an implementation.
