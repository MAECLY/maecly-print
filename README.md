## The problem

Windows hides the **Print** verb from the right-click menu when you select more than ~15 files. Adobe Acrobat doesn't help: it has the same effective limit and is heavyweight. The commercial alternatives that fix this — Print Conductor ($149), 2Printer ($149), Batch & Print Pro ($79.95) — are closed-source and pricey. The few open-source options are abandoned (last release in 2015), depend on Adobe Reader, or are virtual printers, not real batch printers.

So most people end up printing in tedious batches of 15-20 files, manually, again and again.

## What Pluryprint does

Pluryprint adds an entry to the Explorer right-click menu (on Windows 11, under **Show more options**) and to the macOS Finder's **Services** menu:

```
Right-click on any number of files → Pluryprint ▸
                                       ├─ Print 12 files          (default profile)
                                       ├─ ──────────
                                       ├─ Print with “Duplex BW”  (one row per profile, up to 8)
                                       ├─ Print with “Photo Color”
                                       ├─ ──────────
                                       ├─ Configure print job…
                                       └─ Add to print queue
```

- Select **5, 50, or 500** files. They print.
- Use **profiles** (built-in or custom) to lock in your favorite settings: duplex BW, photo color, A3 simplex, whatever.
- **PDF** (encrypted ones too: it asks for the password and never stores it), **images** (JPG, PNG, TIFF, BMP, WebP, HEIC), **SVG**, **Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OpenDocument** (through LibreOffice), **RTF, TXT, HTML and Markdown**. GIF is not supported and is refused with a clear message.
- All **local**: no cloud, no telemetry, no account. A printed page never reaches the network.

The entry sits under **Show more options** on Windows 11 because a top-level entry needs a signed package, and Pluryprint ships without code-signing certificates for now ([ADR-0013](./docs/adr/0013-explorer-command-per-user-verb.md)).

## Status

**Pre-alpha, not yet released.** The repository stays private until the first stable release. What works today:

- **Printing**, end to end, of every format above: PDFs pass through untouched; images, SVG, Markdown and text are converted inside the app; HTML, Markdown and text are paginated by the system's own web view (WebView2 / WebKit) in a sandboxed worker; Office and OpenDocument go through LibreOffice. Everything is spooled through the bundled SumatraPDF on Windows or `lp` (CUPS) on macOS. A missing LibreOffice (or, on Windows, the HEIC codecs) pauses the job, and the app offers to install it after asking.
- **A persistent print queue** (`queue.json`): bounded concurrency, automatic retries with backoff, per-job and whole-queue pause/resume/cancel, crash recovery, and jobs followed in the OS queue until they really print (or end as _unconfirmed_).
- **Profiles and settings on disk**: `profiles.toml` and `config.toml`, written atomically, plus profile import/export.
- **Seven GUI screens** (Home, Print Job, Queue, Printers, Profiles, Settings, About) wired to the real backend, with keyboard shortcuts and the whole UI in English and Spanish.
- **A headless CLI**: `pluryprint print|printers|profiles|queue|update`, `--help` everywhere, `--json` output, and documented exit codes (on Windows, `pluryprint-cli.exe`).
- **A per-user Windows installer** (x64 and ARM64, English and Spanish, no administrator rights) that registers the Explorer entry, and an ad-hoc-signed `.dmg` per Mac architecture.
- **Updates**: a check at start and from About, install in place with signature verification, stable and beta channels, defer / skip-this-version.

**What is NOT here yet:**

- **No published release.** The release workflow builds signed drafts on a tag ([releasing.md](./docs/07-build-and-release/releasing.md)); none has been published.
- **No code-signing certificates**, by decision ([ADR-0011](./docs/adr/0011-release-channel.md)): expect SmartScreen and Gatekeeper warnings; the release notes say how to get past them. Updates are signed with Pluryprint's own key.
- **No top-level Windows 11 menu entry** (see above), and no nightly builds.

## Quick start (developers)

```powershell
# Prerequisites (one-time):
#   1. Node 20 LTS + pnpm 9    -> https://nodejs.org, then `npm i -g pnpm`
#   2. Rust stable 1.78+       -> https://rustup.rs
#   3. Visual Studio Build Tools 2022 with the "Desktop development with C++"
#      workload (incl. Windows 11 SDK + ATL + Spectre Mitigations)
#   4. WebView2 Runtime (preinstalled on Windows 11)
# Detailed checklist in docs/08-development/local-setup.md.

git clone https://github.com/<org>/maecly-print.git
cd maecly-print
pnpm install

# Web preview only (no Tauri host, no IPC):
pnpm dev

# Full Tauri dev loop (requires Rust toolchain):
pnpm tauri dev
```

The web preview renders every screen without the Rust toolchain, but it has no Tauri host: IPC calls fail, so the screens show their empty and error states rather than real printers, jobs or profiles. Use it for layout and styling work only. `pnpm tauri dev` boots the real app against the real backend.

The Explorer context-menu DLL is a separate crate with its own target directory — build and test it with `cargo build --manifest-path shell-ext-win/Cargo.toml` (Windows only; see [`shell-ext-win/README.md`](./shell-ext-win/README.md)). An installer build registers it; [installer-windows.md](./docs/07-build-and-release/installer-windows.md) has the three packaging steps.
