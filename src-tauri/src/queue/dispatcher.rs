//! The single-writer print-queue dispatcher.
//!
//! A [`Dispatcher`] owns the in-memory [`QueueState`] and is the *only* thing
//! that drives jobs through the `Queued → Converting → Converted → Printing →
//! Done` pipeline. All mutations flow through a single [`tokio`] task consuming a
//! [`Cmd`] channel, so there is no lock contention on the state machine itself:
//! the `RwLock` around [`QueueState`] exists only so read-only snapshots
//! ([`QueueHandle::snapshot`](crate::queue::QueueHandle::snapshot)) and the
//! in-flight progress callback can peek without a channel round-trip. The task
//! never holds the write guard across an `.await`.
//!
//! ## Testability
//!
//! The three side-effecting concerns are behind traits — [`JobRunner`] (the
//! engine), [`EventSink`] (Tauri event emission) and [`BlockingSpawner`] (how
//! blocking convert/print work is offloaded). Production wires the real
//! [`EngineRunner`] / [`TauriEmit`] / [`TokioBlockingSpawner`]; tests substitute
//! deterministic fakes and step the loop one [`Cmd`] at a time.
//!
//! ## Concurrency & retry decisions (documented behaviour)
//!
//! - Up to [`DispatcherLimits::max_concurrent`] conversions run at once
//!   (config-driven, defaulting to [`DEFAULT_MAX_CONCURRENT_CONVERSIONS`]);
//!   exactly one print runs at a time (spoolers serialise anyway, and it keeps
//!   job ordering legible). A conversion that outruns
//!   [`DispatcherLimits::conversion_timeout`] is failed with a
//!   `"conversion_timeout"` error (no retry). The print stage is bounded the
//!   same way by [`DispatcherLimits::print_timeout`]: the spooler child is
//!   killed and the job failed with `"print_timeout"` (also terminal), so a hung
//!   `lp`/SumatraPDF can never hold the single print slot forever.
//! - A printer that the OS no longer enumerates — or no configured printer at
//!   all — **pauses** the job with `"printer_unavailable"` instead of failing
//!   it, so the user can pick a replacement
//!   (`docs/03-requirements/print-settings.md` §printer).
//! - `queue_paused` gates *starting* new work only. Work already in flight runs
//!   to completion; a converting job that finishes while the queue is paused
//!   still reaches `Converted`, it just won't advance to `Printing`.
//! - Retry (FR-034): [`EngineError::UnsupportedSetting`] and
//!   [`EngineError::DependencyMissing`] are user-fixable, so the job is
//!   **Paused** with the error and never auto-retried — the user fixes the
//!   setting/driver and resumes. Any other error bumps `attempts`; the job gets
//!   the initial attempt plus three automatic retries (backoffs 1s/5s/25s); once
//!   `attempts >= MAX_ATTEMPTS` the job is **Failed**, otherwise it returns to
//!   the start of its stage (`Queued` for a conversion failure, `Converted` for
//!   a print failure — the cached PDF is kept) and a delayed `RetryDue` is
//!   scheduled after a [`RETRY_BACKOFFS`] backoff. Delayed jobs are held in a
//!   `delayed` set that the scheduler skips until the timer fires.
//! - Pause of a `Converting` job sets its cancel flag and moves it to `Paused`;
//!   the in-flight conversion aborts and its partial cache is discarded, so the
//!   job re-converts on resume. Pausing a `Printing` job is rejected
//!   (`InvalidState`) — the OS already owns it.
//! - Resume of a `Paused` job returns it to `Converted` when its cached PDF is
//!   still on disk, otherwise to `Queued`. The error is always cleared; a job
//!   paused by shutdown recovery (`interrupted_by_shutdown`) also has its
//!   `attempts` reset so it gets a clean run.
//! - Resume of a job paused with `printer_unavailable` **re-resolves the
//!   printer first** (`plan_printer_fix`, on the blocking pool — it reads the OS
//!   printer list). If the pinned printer is back, the
//!   job resumes onto it; if it is still gone but preferences now point
//!   somewhere usable — which is what the Printers screen's "Update references"
//!   reconciliation edits — the pin is dropped so dispatch follows them; and if
//!   nothing resolves, the resume is **refused** with what to fix instead of
//!   silently re-pausing. Without this a job pinned to a printer that
//!   disappeared was stuck forever: resuming re-ran the same failed lookup and
//!   nothing could re-point it.
//! - **A print is done when the printer is done, not when the spooler accepts
//!   it.** Once `spool` returns an OS job id the job stays `Printing` and the
//!   dispatcher polls the spooler through [`JobTracker`] with backoff
//!   ([`TRACK_BACKOFFS`], then every [`TRACK_POLL_CAP`]). `completed` (or the
//!   job leaving the queue) → `Done`; `canceled` → `Cancelled`; `aborted` →
//!   `Failed`; a held job stays `Printing` with the `"held"` progress phase and
//!   a stopped printer with `"stopped"`. The whole print — spooling plus
//!   tracking — is bounded by [`DispatcherLimits::print_timeout`]; running out
//!   fails the job with `print_timeout` and leaves the OS job alone (cancelling
//!   a job the printer may still print would lose it). A backend that cannot
//!   report job state at all, or a job id it could not recover, falls back to
//!   `Done` on hand-off, as before tracking existed.
//! - **One print slot.** It is taken when a job starts spooling and released
//!   only when its OS job leaves the queue (or the print fails), so the next
//!   job never reaches the spooler while the previous one is still printing.
//! - Cancel of a `Printing` job marks it `Cancelled` at once. If its OS job id
//!   is already known, the OS job is cancelled and the slot freed there and
//!   then; if it is still spooling, the slot stays taken until `PrintDone`
//!   arrives, which then cancels the OS job and deletes the cache — so a
//!   cancelled job can never share the printer with the next one.
