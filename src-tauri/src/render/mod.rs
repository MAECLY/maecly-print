//! HTML → PDF through the operating system's own web view (FR-055, D15):
//! WebView2 `PrintToPdf` on Windows, `WKWebView` printing on macOS. Runs only
//! inside the render worker ([`crate::worker::render`]), never in the app or
//! the CLI process itself, so a hostile page that crashes or wedges the web
//! view takes the worker down, not Pluryprint.
//!
//! The engine ([`crate::engine::convert::html`]) stages the page it wants
//! printed (the user's HTML, or the HTML made from Markdown or text) in the
//! job's work directory and hands the worker a [`RenderRequest`].
//!
//! **The boundary is the web view's network layer** (round 6). What a page
//! may fetch is decided on the exact URL the web view resolved, at the point
//! it would fetch it, never by a text pre-scan of the HTML (a second parser
//! always disagrees with the real one somewhere; security notes 5-7). The
//! worker loads the staged page with:
//!
//! - **no script**: the web view's own switch (`IsScriptEnabled = false`,
//!   `allowsContentJavaScript = false`), on top of the page's
//!   `script-src 'none'` policy;
//! - **an allow-list of fetches**: on Windows a WebView2
//!   `WebResourceRequested` filter on `*` for every resource kind answers
//!   **every** request itself ([`is_allowed_request`]): the private origin
//!   ([`DOC_HOST`]) from the staged page and the document's folder
//!   ([`serve`]); `data:`, `blob:` and `about:blank` load as they are;
//!   anything else (another host, `http`, `ws`, `file:`, a UNC path) gets a
//!   synthetic 403 and is written to the worker's stderr (the job's
//!   `render.log`). On macOS (round 7) the worker answers its own private
//!   scheme, [`MAC_DOC_SCHEME`] on [`DOC_HOST`], with a `WKURLSchemeHandler`
//!   that serves the staged page and the document's folder the same way
//!   ([`resolve`], [`open_in_folder`]), and a `WKContentRuleList`
//!   ([`webkit_rule_list`]) blocks every other load: every `file:` URL and
//!   every network scheme; only that origin, `data:`, `blob:` and
//!   `about:blank` pass;
//! - **no navigation**: every navigation other than the worker's own load of
//!   the page (a `<meta http-equiv=refresh>`, a frame, a link target, a new
//!   window) is cancelled, and refused ones are logged;
//! - **no file share**: a reference such as `//host/x.png` or
//!   `file://host/share/x.png` would make Windows open `\\host\share` over SMB
//!   or WebDAV and hand the user's NTLM credentials to that host. On Windows
//!   the page is therefore not loaded from `file:` at all: the worker serves
//!   it, and the document's folder, itself on one private `https` origin,
//!   from which Chromium refuses every `file:` sub-resource, and a
//!   protocol-relative reference resolves to `https:`, which the filter
//!   refuses. Every path it serves is checked by the shared share predicate
//!   ([`crate::engine::convert::local_ref`]). On macOS the page is not
//!   loaded from `file:` either, and the rule list refuses every `file:` URL.
//! - **one origin**: the staged page and the document's folder share that
//!   origin, so same-folder web fonts (CORS-mode requests) and external SVG
//!   `<use>` (same-origin only) load as they do from the user's folder.
//! - **only the page's folder readable**: the worker serves the staged page
//!   and files inside the document's folder, nothing else, and checks each
//!   file on the handle it reads from: on Windows its final path
//!   (`GetFinalPathNameByHandleW`) must lie inside the folder; on macOS
//!   [`open_in_folder`] opens it component by component without following a
//!   link out of the folder, then checks its `F_GETPATH`. Neither web view
//!   reads a document file by itself. (Round 6 confined WebKit with a
//!   `file:` URL prefix only; round 7 showed a symbolic link inside the
//!   folder passed that prefix and WebKit followed it anywhere.)
//! - **bounded**: the worker gives up by itself after the job's conversion
//!   timeout ([`RenderRequest::timeout_secs`], none when the setting is 0),
//!   printing [`TIMEOUT_MARKER`] so the engine reports a timeout (terminal),
//!   not a render failure it would retry.
//!
//! The page size comes from the job ([`RenderRequest::paper_in`]) and is set
//! natively on the print settings, so it does not depend on the page's CSS.
