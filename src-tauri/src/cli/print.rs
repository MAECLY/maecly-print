//! `pluryprint print …` (FR-008).
//!
//! The headless print hop. It resolves a profile plus the per-invocation
//! overrides into one [`JobSettings`], applies exactly the acceptance rules
//! [`crate::queue::QueueHandle::submit`] applies (existence, size ceiling,
//! supported format, settings and page-range validity), then walks the files
//! one at a time through the same engine the dispatcher uses:
//! [`crate::engine::convert`] → [`crate::engine::print::spool`].
//!
//! Two deliberate differences from the GUI queue, both because a CLI run is a
//! *foreground* operation that ends when the process ends:
//!
//! - **No `queue.json`, no persistence.** A headless run never touches the
//!   queue file, so it cannot race a running app for it (NFR-014). Its jobs are
//!   ephemeral by definition — the process holding them is about to exit.
//! - **Its own conversion cache.** Converted PDFs go to a private temp
//!   directory that is deleted on exit, rather than the shared conversions
//!   cache the GUI sweeps at boot. Neither process can delete the other's work.
//!
//! There is no retry/backoff either: a script wants an exit code, not a job
//! that quietly retries for half a minute.
