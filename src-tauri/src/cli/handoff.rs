//! The JSON handoff file: how a shell extension hands a selection to the app.
//!
//! Windows caps a command line at 32,767 characters, so a selection of a few
//! hundred files cannot travel in argv. The shell extension therefore writes
//! the selection to `<data_dir>/handoff/sel-<uuid>.json` and launches
//! `maeclyprint --invoke=context-menu --files-from <path>`; the only variable
//! part of that command line is one path. There is deliberately **no**
//! "small selections go through argv" shortcut: one code path is one code path
//! to test.
//!
//! Anything under the handoff directory is written by another process, so this
//! module treats the file as untrusted input: the schema version must match, the
//! file and the path list are size-capped, and a context-menu payload must be
//! fresh ([`is_fresh`]) and live inside the expected directory
//! ([`is_within_dir`]) before it is honoured. Everything here is pure except
//! [`read_file`]/[`consume`]/[`sweep`], which are the only functions that touch
//! the disk.
