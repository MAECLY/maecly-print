//! Selections waiting for the window (NFR-014, FR-001).
//!
//! A selection can reach the app in two ways: it is on the command line of the
//! process that boots the GUI, or it arrives later from a *second* launch that
//! the single-instance plugin forwarded ([`crate::cli::single_instance`]).
//! Either way the webview may not exist yet, so the selection is parked in
//! [`PendingSelections`] (Tauri managed state) and delivered twice over:
//!
//! - the window drains it once it has mounted, via [`take_pending_selections`];
//! - an *already open* window also gets a [`SelectionForwarded`] event, so a
//!   second launch feels instant instead of waiting for a poll.
//!
//! Draining is destructive on purpose: a selection is a one-shot instruction,
//! and re-delivering it on the next reload would re-print the user's files.
