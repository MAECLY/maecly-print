//! Headless CLI and the argv contract (FR-008/009/010/112, NFR-014).
//!
//! The binary has three possible starts, decided by [`startup`] from argv
//! **before** anything else happens — no Tauri builder, no webview, no queue:
//!
//! | argv                                        | mode         | window? |
//! | ------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------- |
//! | `--invoke=context-menu --files-from <PATH>`  | context menu | yes, pre-loaded |
//! | `print …` / `printers …` / … / `--cli` / `--help` | headless | **no** |
//! | anything else                                | GUI          | yes     |
//!
//! Order matters and matches `docs/04-architecture/ipc-and-cli.md` §3.1:
//! `--invoke=context-menu` wins over everything (a shell extension must never
//! be reinterpreted as a subcommand), then a known subcommand or `--cli`, then
//! the GUI.
//!
//! ## Why the decision lives here and not in `run()`
//!
//! `maeclyprint print --files a.pdf` must not create a window, so the split
//! has to happen in `main` before [`crate::run_with`] is even called.
//! [`startup`] therefore returns either "the work is done, exit with this
//! code" or "boot the GUI, and here is the selection to pre-load".
//!
//! ## What the CLI is allowed to be
//!
//! A facade. Every subcommand calls the same path-injected core the matching
//! Tauri command calls (`ipc::profiles::*_at`, `ipc::settings::*_at`,
//! `platform::*`, `update::*`, `queue::persist`), so there is exactly one
//! implementation of every rule. The only logic that lives here is what only
//! a command line needs: argument vocabulary, name→id lookup, file expansion,
//! output formatting and exit codes.
