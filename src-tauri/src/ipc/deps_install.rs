//! FR-058: guided installation of a missing dependency (winget, Homebrew, the
//! Microsoft Store or the vendor's web page), always after the user's explicit
//! consent, never silently (decision D13).
//!
//! The UI gets the options from the dependency report
//! ([`crate::engine::deps::DependencyReport::install`]): for each, the exact
//! command that will run (or the page that will open), whether Windows will
//! ask for administrator rights (LibreOffice's MSI) and whether it costs money
//! (HEVC). The consent dialog shows all of it; only its *Install* button sends
//! `consent: true`, and nothing runs without it.
//!
//! - **winget / brew** run with an argument vector (no shell), their output
//!   streamed line by line as [`DependencyInstallProgress`] events, bounded by
//!   [`INSTALL_TIMEOUT`]. One install at a time; the user can stop it
//!   ([`cancel_dependency_install`]), which kills the whole process tree it
//!   can reach. When that cannot be confirmed (an elevated installer that
//!   refuses the kill, or an MSI the Windows Installer service runs outside
//!   the tree) the outcome says so,
//!   [`InstallStatus::CancelRequestedInstallerMayContinue`], never a plain
//!   "stopped"; a timeout the installer may outlive likewise ends in
//!   [`InstallStatus::TimedOutInstallerMayContinue`]. The one-install slot is
//!   then kept until the installer is seen gone, or a grace period ends
//!   ([`linger`]), so a second install never runs beside it.
//! - [`dependency_install_status`] says which install holds the slot, so a
//!   reloaded window finds a running install again instead of offering an
//!   Install the backend would refuse.
//! - **Store / web** open the page with the OS handler; the user finishes
//!   there.
//!
//! When a command finishes the dependency is probed again and the fresh
//! report comes back, so the UI knows at once whether the files it blocked can
//! print now.
