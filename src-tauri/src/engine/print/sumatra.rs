//! SumatraPDF backend: `-print-settings` string construction (pure, all
//! platforms), locating the executable via [`crate::engine::deps`], and, on
//! Windows, spooling.
//!
//! Flag mapping (`docs/03-requirements/print-settings.md` §SumatraPDF table).
//! The `-print-settings` value is a comma-separated keyword list; SumatraPDF is
//! order-independent, but we emit a fixed order for a stable, testable preview.
//!
//! | Setting               | Token(s)                                   |
//! |-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
//! | page ranges           | bare `1-5,10` (prepended, no key)          |
//! | duplex none/long/short| `simplex` / `duplex` / `duplexshort`       |
//! | colour / monochrome   | `color` / `monochrome`                     |
//! | scaling fit/shrink/none| `fit` / `shrink` / `noscale`              |
//! | paper                 | `paperkind=<DMPAPER id>`                   |
//! | tray                  | `bin=<DMBIN id>`                           |
//! | copies > 1            | `<n>x` (e.g. `3x`)                         |
//! | orientation land/port | `landscape` / `portrait` *(auto omitted)*  |
//! | **quality**           | **no token — a temporary per-user default, see below** |
//!
//! The doc table lists only `duplex`/`duplexshort`; SumatraPDF also accepts
//! `simplex` and `noscale`, which we use for the "none" cases so every setting
//! is stated explicitly. Copies use `<n>x`, the only spelling SumatraPDF's
//! parser accepts; an unknown token such as `copies=N` is skipped without a
//! warning, which is how an earlier version printed one copy of everything.
//!
//! ## Paper and tray go by id
//!
//! SumatraPDF's `paper=<name>` and `bin=<name>` look the name up in the
//! **driver's** list (`DC_PAPERNAMES`, `DC_BINNAMES`), which is localized: on
//! Spanish Windows Letter is "Carta", so `paper=Letter` matched nothing and
//! the job silently printed on the size of the document's first page. Both
//! also accept the numeric id, and that is all we send: `paperkind=<id>` with
//! the `DMPAPER_*` id (the driver's own id for a driver paper name, the
//! standard one for a size Pluryprint names), `bin=<id>` with the driver's
//! `DMBIN_*` id for the bin name. A tray name with a comma in it now works
//! too, since the name never reaches the comma-separated list. A paper or
//! tray the driver does not list cannot be sent, and [`unsupported_notes`]
//! says so.
//!
//! ## Quality
//!
//! SumatraPDF has no print-quality switch, but it starts every job from the
//! printer's per-user default DEVMODE. For Draft and High,
//! [`super::devmode_swap`] makes a DEVMODE with that quality the user's
//! default only while SumatraPDF hands the job over, then restores it and
//! reads the job back to log what it really got. Normal is never forced: it is
//! what the driver does anyway. [`quality_note`] tells the user which of
//! those will happen before printing.
