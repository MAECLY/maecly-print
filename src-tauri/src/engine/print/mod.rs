//! Printer dispatch facade.
//!
//! One printable PDF plus a [`JobSettings`] becomes a real spooler invocation
//! here. The per-backend flag translation lives in [`cups`] (CUPS `lp`, Unix)
//! and [`sumatra`] (SumatraPDF, Windows); this module picks the backend for the
//! current platform and also exposes:
//!
//! - [`preview_command`] — the exact command string shown in the UI's "this is
//!   what we'll run" panel (honesty policy: no hidden flags),
//! - [`check_supported`] — the pure capability gate the dispatcher calls before
//!   spooling,
//! - [`effective_settings`] — the per-input narrowing of the batch settings
//!   (page ranges are a PDF-only concept), and
//! - [`wait_with_timeout`] — the bounded child wait every backend spools
//!   through, so a wedged spooler can never hold the queue forever, and
//! - [`job_state`] / [`cancel_os_job`] — following a spooled job until it
//!   leaves the OS queue, so "done" means the printer finished rather than
//!   "the spooler accepted the file".
