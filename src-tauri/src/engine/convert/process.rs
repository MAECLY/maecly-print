//! Bounded execution of an external converter (LibreOffice, `sips`, `textutil`,
//! the render and SVG workers).
//!
//! Every converter that shells out goes through [`run_bounded`], which is where
//! the three promises of `docs/03-requirements/supported-formats.md` live:
//!
//! - **No shell.** The program and its arguments are a [`Command`] argument
//!   vector; nothing is ever interpolated into a shell string, so a file called
//!   `$(rm -rf ~).docx` is just an odd file name.
//! - **Bounded.** The child is polled against a deadline *and* the job's cancel
//!   flag. The dispatcher's `conversion_timeout` sets that flag, so a hung
//!   `soffice` is killed rather than left to hold a conversion slot forever.
//! - **Killed for real.** Office suites and browsers fork helpers
//!   (`soffice.bin`, renderer processes). On Unix the child leads its own
//!   process group and the whole group is killed; on Windows `taskkill /T`
//!   takes the tree. `Child::kill` is always issued as well, as the floor.
//!
//! stderr goes to a file in the work directory rather than a pipe: a chatty
//! child can never fill a pipe buffer and deadlock against our polling loop,
//! and the tail of it becomes the user-visible failure detail.
