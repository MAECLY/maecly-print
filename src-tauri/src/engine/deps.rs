//! External-dependency detection (FR-058).
//!
//! The hybrid engine (ADR-0003) shells out to programs we do not compile: the
//! final PDF printer on Windows (SumatraPDF) and the best-of-breed converters
//! the architecture reserves for Office/HTML/Markdown (LibreOffice, a
//! Chromium-class browser, Pandoc). None of them is guaranteed to exist on a
//! user's machine, so every one of them is *resolved* before it is *run*, and a
//! missing one produces a remediation message instead of an opaque
//! "failed to spawn" deep inside a job.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! - [`resolve`] is the whole decision and it is **pure**: it takes the
//!   candidate directories, the executable names, and an `exists` predicate,
//!   and returns where the program was found. It reads no environment variable
//!   and touches no global state, so the search order is testable against a
//!   tempdir on any OS.
//! - [`bundled_dirs`], [`path_dirs`] and [`install_dirs`] gather that input from
//!   the real machine. Only [`install_dirs`] needs environment variables, and it
//!   takes the lookup as a parameter for the same reason.
//! - [`report`] / [`report_all`] glue the two together and produce the typed
//!   [`DependencyReport`] the IPC layer ships to the UI.
//!
//! # Search order (identical for every dependency)
//!
//! 1. **Bundled** — next to our own executable, in the layout the installer
//!    produces (see `bundle.resources` in `tauri.conf.json`). A copy we ship
//!    always wins: it is the version we tested against.
//! 2. **Configured** — an explicit path the user pointed us at. There is no
//!    such setting in `config.toml` today, so callers pass `None`; the slot
//!    exists because the resolver is where the precedence has to live once one
//!    is added, and adding it later must not reshuffle the other three steps.
//! 3. **`PATH`** — the user's own install, however they manage it.
//! 4. **Well-known install directories** — the per-OS defaults the vendors'
//!    installers use.
//!
//! # Honesty
//!
//! [`Spec::blocks`] lists exactly the extensions that cannot print while this
//! dependency is missing — always a subset of
//! [`crate::engine::SUPPORTED_EXTS`], and taken from the converter routing
//! tables in [`crate::engine::convert`] so the two cannot drift. The
//! remediation text names the dependency and how to install it; the converter
//! returns the same text as `DependencyMissing` when a job needs it (FR-058).
