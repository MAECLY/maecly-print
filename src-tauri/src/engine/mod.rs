//! Print engine: format router, converters (everything → PDF) and per-OS
//! printer adapters (see `docs/04-architecture/print-engine.md` and ADR-0003).
//!
//! The engine has three pure-ish concerns, one per submodule:
//!
//! - [`pagerange`] — parse/validate `"1-5,10"` page-range expressions.
//! - folder expansion ([`expand_folder`]) — turn a dropped/selected directory
//!   into the list of printable files inside it (FR-004/FR-007), keeping the
//!   discarded ones with a reason (FR-005/FR-059).
//! - [`convert`] — turn a supported input file into a printable PDF (PDFs pass
//!   through; images are rasterised in-process; HEIC goes through the OS
//!   decoder; documents through LibreOffice, a headless browser or Pandoc).
//! - [`print`] — translate [`crate::queue::job::JobSettings`] into the
//!   SumatraPDF (Windows) / CUPS `lp` (Unix) invocation and spool it.
//! - [`deps`] — locate the external programs the pipeline shells out to
//!   (SumatraPDF and the documented converters) and say what a missing one
//!   costs the user (FR-058).
//!
//! Everything is small and testable: the flag builders and parsers are pure
//! functions with co-located unit tests; only the `spool`/`cancel` entry points
//! actually spawn a process, and those are `cfg`-gated per platform.
